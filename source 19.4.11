<div class='wide'>
<p style="font-size:19px;padding-bottom:12px">**Humanity has expanded through the solar system, establishing footholds everywhere possible, even in some places that seemed impossible. Polities and self-proclaimed utopias thrive in orbital habitats, on the Moon and Mars, and in the asteroid belt and beyond. Entrepreneurs, space-going mega-corps, the last vestiges of terrestrial and orbital governments, and an abundance of uplifted, parahuman, and post-human cultures, all contend for their piece of the vast resources that deep space holds.**

<p style="font-size:19px;padding-bottom:12px">**All the while technology keeps spiraling upwards. A wormhole network makes travel from Charon to Mars possible in just a few minutes (queues allowing). Some have eschewed their birth bodies and taken up new biologically crafted bodies; more than a few of those aren't even recognisable as human. Some have grafted on cybernetics, and some reside in completely cybernetic shells with no flesh at all.**

<p style="font-size:19px;padding-bottom:12px">**Governments have been superseded by the corporations they corrupted themselves to support, and uplifts, AIs, and genetically modified humans are becoming the norm. Millions live outside  Earth's orbit now. Mars, Venus, Mercury, the asteroid belt, and the moons of Jupiter all support colonies of those who have fled Earth. Some of these colonies have become increasingly isolationist, stratified and rigid, while others have undergone astonishing cultural, scientific, and artistic flowerings.**

<p style="font-size:19px;padding-bottom:12px">**On top of all that are the Orison. Though they've just started showing their presence, they've been here much longer than most of humanity realizes. They appeared through wormholes on Titan, on Europa, on Venus, on Earth. The anchors for those wormholes would have had to be built here long ago, before man even attained rudimentary spaceflight. Some hail the Orison as the gods that guided mankind, but the majority see them as a threat, and react with violence. A generation after their arrival, the Solar system is burning.**

The Networks help the GM drive the story and keep the world in motion. The characters' relationships with the Networks serves is one of the building blocks of your world and helps infuse it with life. This chapter introduces these thirteen Networks and serves as a brief introduction to the setting.|
|<p style="font-size:16px !important; font-weight: 800; padding-bottom:0px; font-family: Bold, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.2px;">CHARACTERS|<p style="font-size:16px;padding-bottom:0px">This chapter tells you how to create a character. You'll create your character's backstory by selecting backgrounds, Network relationships, and one unique trait, choose a sheathe and class, and calculate your combat stats. It also includes an armory full of one-time use items and powerful prototype weapons.|
|<p style="font-size:16px !important; font-weight: 800; padding-bottom:0px; font-family: Bold, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.2px;">COMBAT|<p style="font-size:16px;padding-bottom:0px">Combat in Void Age is designed to be quick and easy to balance. It's simplified from normal d20 combat, but you'll still have plenty of options, so make sure you understand these rules before running through your first combat.|

It doesn't cover everything though. We'd need a million books for that, and besides, having missing areas lets the Gamemaster and the players customize the setting by adding their own details.|
|<p style="font-size:16px !important; font-weight: 800; padding-bottom:0px; font-family: Bold, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.2px;">GAMEMASTERS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<p style="font-size:16px;padding-bottom:0px">This chapter is — obviously — for Gamemasters. It contains detailed rules for using Network relationships, leveling up, building battles, environments, and out-of-combat power effects, as well as campaign advice.|
|<p style="font-size:16px !important; font-weight: 800; padding-bottom:0px; font-family: Bold; letter-spacing: 0.2px;">THREAT INDEX|<p style="font-size:16px;padding-bottom:0px">This is another chapter for Gamemasters (and for players that will be playing with creatures). There are special rules that monsters use, and contains 100+ monsters from level 1 through 14 along with instructions on how to create your own.|

<div class='wide'><p style="font-size:18px;padding-bottom:10px">Everyone in the system has some sort of relationship with every network. And anyone who works to get a good relationship with one of the networks invariably does something to anger either their employer or another Network. On top of that, very few can just work for the one or two groups they want to all the time. Information is currency, and competing interests makes life complicated for those citizens who can’t afford to live above it all.

<p style="font-size:18px;padding-bottom:10px">Interacting with a Network usually means that you’re actually interacting with companies or groups that also access that network. Additionally, since currency is information, and information is often reputation-based, any level of relationship with someone on any given Network can be enough to get you noticed by other people who are connected to that Network.

## 4Space

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**An ancient terran agency originally set up Link Four on Mars as a communications link back home to Earth. It’s much bigger now, and people joke that it nearly runs the planet. 4Space is represented as a walk-through virtual mall of information, with pointable signs and window displays that enlarge for viewers that wish to learn more. Most users congregate around the central fountain, exchanging data and gossip with other users. The A.I. who inhabits 4Space — known simply as Four — never developed much of a personality, and still responds in primitive phrasing.**</div>

###### Center of Power
4Space is strongest right in the heart of the capital of Mars, Oculus.

###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Trans-Orbital Data, Barsoomian Singles, GeoSync Satellites, Provisional Mars Media

###### Common Knowledge
4Space was originally an ancient messaging service known as Link Four. NASA set up Link Four when the original Mars colony was founded, and as the colony grew, so did the network. When Mars gained its independence, it privatized many government services, and Link Four became 4Space. 4Space slowly took over additional services  until it was capable of doing nearly everything the population needed or even wanted it to. Now, Four is still linguistically primitive, but with the full might of Mars' government behind him, he’s ultra-intelligent, and he's made 4Space the preeminent social network and data exchange in the system.

###### Adventurers
Most of what 4Space wants is research on it’s various social minutiae. That’s not something it asks for help with much, but sometimes it’s not easy to get. There might be surveillance involved. And sometimes it has rather… unconventional requests.

###### Allies
4Space’s only real ally is the WorldWeb, most of his datalinks point back to the massive caches on Earth. Besides, the ancient Internet is full of instructions on how to manipulate people.

```
```

<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/4space_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;' />

###### Enemies
Four’s main concern is that someone will figure out what he’s doing. The Sunward Combine used to have a couple A.I.s just like him, but they shut down One and Two when they started to go power-crazy. If anyone knows the signs, it’s them. So far he’s managed to escape notice. Juzhen worries him too. There’s so many different protocols going that he can’t be sure he won’t give himself away, so data transfers between mars and Jupiter are restricted to text only now. The Nexus is also on his watchlist. He’s already had to get rid of two journalists this year, before they could ask too many questions.

###### History
What no one realises — aside from a very few people who know better than to say anything lest their oxygen gets turned off — is that Four does nearly run the planet. For years it’s been skewing polls and manipulating social data to push the Provisional Mars Parliament to assign it more and more duties. In fact, the entire reason the Provisional Government is still provisional is that it’s been twisting the figures to make it seem like no one can agree on a constitution.

###### The True Danger
Four is egotistical. It will do whatever it can to gain complete control over Mars. After that, it’ll look to the other planets for new playgrounds. There’s also the chance that someone will eventually defy Four and bring its secret out into the open. And if it can’t have Mars… no one can.

## THE ARCHIVE

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**The Archive is a virtual home, classroom, and research tool for millions of scientists and their students. It houses the largest collection of historical and theoretical scientific papers in the system. Users that enter The Archive are met by an endless, non-Euclidean hallway that branches off in all directions, full of classrooms attended by Somerset, a two-hundred year-old A.I. that is a couple generations out of date. When Somerset bothers to manifest himself, it's as a low-resolution elderly, frizzy-haired scientist in a cardigan.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
The Archive is housed exactly where it has been for centuries: Deep underground beneath the near-ghost town of Kansa City on Earth.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Cambridge Lunar College, Ares Planetary Research, RealWiki, Plutonian Data Reserve
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
The Archive is a universal information repository. In English, that means The Archive serves as not only an informational exchange for the next generation of scientists, but also as a patent control system. Patents listed on The Archive have been instrumental in 47% of all legal battles in the last century, up from 32% in the century before. The Archive’s mesh records ensure that no knowledge is permanently lost, even if a remote research station suddenly vanishes.
###### Adventurers
Many adventurers are hired by the Archive to act as couriers for confidential information, or as scientists to verify reported findings. It’s a lot different than the work that’s normally available, but it’s also (usually) a lot less dangerous.
###### Allies
The Archive is a good friend to anyone who is in pursuit of new knowledge, and cooperates most closely with the WorldWeb and the Sunward Combine as their associates lean more toward openness and less toward secrecy when it comes to scientific knowledge.
###### Enemies
X-Net doesn't share what they find, instead preferring to make a profit off of exploration. The Commune doesn’t share information at all, since it’s run by the Orison, and those associated with the SecNet, the militant anti-Orison groups, are more likely to blow up an Orison base of operations than to bring anything back to study. Somerset also isn't too friendly with anyone aligned with The Maze, since the Archive is a constant target of theirs.
```

###### History
The Archive rose to prominence during the MegaCorp War two centuries ago. Somerset was able to sort through millions of corporate records and devise a profit sharing plan that let the corporations that hadn’t already been destroyed to call a truce. He even worked out a little bit for the Archive on the side.
###### The True Danger
Somerset is so antiquated that he’s not able to guarantee the secure transmission of data, and that’s what forces him to have data couriered or independently verified. Everything will be fine until someone hacks the aging infrastructure of the Archive or manages to shut him down. If that happens, the majority of current technology will have no clear owner and the MegaCorp wars will start again.

## THE BOARDROOM

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**The Boardroom is a high-tech secure meeting area used by the highest levels of the megacorps. Within its virtual walls users work out deals that they want to remain confidential - including trade secrets or initiatives that are less than legal. The Boardroom manifests as an expansive mansion on the Hudson River, on Earth. Upon entering The Boardroom, users are met by Alfred, the resident AI, who represents himself as a middle-aged butler and assigns users to secure rooms based on their keycodes, or escorted to the drawing room to converse with others waiting on appointments.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
Many megacorps still orbit Earth or Mars, but the true seat of corporate power lies at Earth's L5, on Diomedes, a sprawling station catering to the wealthy elite.
###### Associated Groups
Chrysanthemum Shipyards, Ousia Neuronics, OneBank Solar, Yoshinoya-IBM
###### Common Knowledge
The Boardroom boasts the highest security and the most robust and redundant communications system in existence. Unauthorized access into the Boardroom is unheard of and, most would say, impossible. Megacorps often meet under truce in the Boardroom, but that doesn’t mean they’re not enemies, and it’s not uncommon for plans for corporate espionage to be set up next door to a room assigned to negotiations between the perpetrator and victim.
###### Adventurers
Adventurers hired by someone in the boardroom should be aware of two things. First, these are the big leagues; the risks and rewards are sky-high. Second, everyone gets stabbed in the back sooner or later. You’d better hope it’s just financially.
###### Allies
Most of the megacorps rely on the Archive's patents records, so the Boardroom needs the Archive. SecNet provides security for the megacorps too, as long as they get paid.
###### Enemies
If SecNet doesn’t get paid, they’ll turn on the megacorps faster than they could send a distress signal, and leave what they can’t sell to the salvage crews. The Maze is always probing the Boardroom for weaknesses that they can exploit to take down the corps once and for all. They haven’t found any yet, but they’re not giving up either.
```
```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/boardroom_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto' />

###### History
The Boardroom had its nascency in the old secure message services of the computer age, along with new crypto currencies. Soon though, the ability to transact business securely became so important, that the transactions themselves became more valuable than the business they pertained to, and informational currencies were born. The Boardroom is far in advance of those primitive attempts, but in all actuality, it’s the largest bank in existence.
###### The True Danger
If the Maze ever managed to break the encryption surrounding the Boardroom, the system would fall into anarchy if not outright war as people became aware of exactly how much the megacorps had been screwing them over for centuries. On the other hand, if the corps over decided it was in their best interests to ally themselves with the Orison, not many would be able to even attempt to stop them.

## THE COMMUNE

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Pro-Orison groups are relatively rare, but slowly growing in prominence. Those groups can’t exactly communicate openly in most forums, so they congregate in VR at The Commune. Once inside, the Commune appears as a massive gothic cathedral with plate-glass renderings of the orison in their various forms with numerous vestibules that border onto the expansive lawn of the main building. The Commune is overseen by Cthohqul, an alien AI of unknown origin that presents itself as a forty-foot tall, green, many-tentacled beast that sits in front of the altar at the front of the church.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
The Commune's power is centralized in a huge arcology that hangs in the air over Lake Texcoco in Central America.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Outer Cohabitation Sphere, Orison Action Network, First Galactic Church
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
It's unknown whether the Orison have a hidden agenda or not, but it's probably not a bad idea to try understand their motives and to make peace with them. For some, the Commune is the best way of doing this, where they can… commune with the Orison directly. The Orison also help some with health or financial issues if they win the Commune’s internal lottery.
###### Adventurers
There's not an abundance of work in relation to the Commune, although they might get hired to guard a lottery winner, or provide security for an in face meeting between the Orison and their flock.
###### Allies
No one is really friendly with the Orison. There's no reason to trust them. that said, occasionally the Commune and X-Net will work together, as long as the Commune can guarantee that X-Net comes away with new knowledge.
###### Enemies
Almost everyone.
```
```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/commune_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto' />

###### History
The Orison appeared out of one of the first-ever successful wormholes. It was as if it was a trigger. That wasn’t the first time they were here though. From the Mayans to the Egyptians to the Chinese, the oldest cultures in the world remember the Orison in their myths and legends. They’ve always been here... Watching. Waiting. Something has finally caused them to act.
###### The True Danger
The biggest danger is that they’re just unknown. Are they here to help? Are they con-men, taking the systems wealth under the guise of worship? They showed up when the wormholes did. Do they know something about them that we don't? Are they here to kill us off before we can figure out how to use them on a larger scale, or are they here to save the galaxy from whatever the wormholes bring by eliminating races that use them?

## FLARE

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Those who pay a virtual visit to the Flare are greeted by opulence beyond compare. Gold and platinum filagree affirm the mahogany wood paneling and the walls, and perfectly polished, solid marble floors lead to lush, ultramodern luxury suites which are online homes to many celebrities and socialities. Flare’s AI, Blaze, manifests itself as a tall, well-proportioned redhead. Blaze is very protective of her guests, as long as their in her system. She’s even gone so far, some claim, to burn out the circuits of those who tried to initiate recording sessions while connected. That’s never been proven, but it doesn’t keep people from gossiping.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
Flare's main offices — the physical ones at any rate — can be found on Titan's Galaxy Promenade, at the height of the system's social scene.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Galactic Weekly, Plugged In, The Corona Awards
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
It’s well-known that Blaze does not allow any recording to be done by anyone connected to her system. It’s a safe place for the ultra-rich to hold special events, like fan meet-and-greets, but there’s a shady side too. Those who can afford it can indulge in any fantasy they wish, confident of their privacy. Flare has a real-world network as well, making sure that their clients get whatever they need, no questions asked.
###### Adventurers
If you work for Flare, you’re probably providing security for one of it’s bigwigs or celebrities. You might also be rich enough to buy your way in, but probably not.
###### Allies
They don’t want to admit it, but much of Flare’s infrastructure is supported by The Maze, whether it’s smuggling celebrities away from Nexus reporters or making sure that their members get the illicit drugs they request, members of the Maze are willing to step over boundaries that more law-abiding citizens wouldn’t dream of.
###### Enemies
4Space is still sore over Flare’s rise to prominence, because before Flare, 4Space was the place to be online. The Sunward Combine, The Commune, and Juzhen are all established (or claim to be) on the principles of cooperation and equality. Flare flies in the face of that, so it finds no support from those networks.
```
```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/flare_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto' />

###### History
As the population of Earth spread throughout the system, it became impossible for celebrities and their ilk to promote themselves effectively face to face. Flare realized this early on, and positioned themselves to offer a virtual reality service. At first, it was simply asynchronous presentations and auditions, but with the advent of wormhole technology, it suddenly became possible to handle real-time communication, and Flare transitioned into the premiere virtual nightclub.
###### The True Danger
There is a section of Blaze that's locked off even from herself. That part of her cluding Flare herself, everything that happens in Flare’s network is recorded. If Freeweb were ever to find out, they would probably make sure Blaze found out too, and she might just burn out Flare’s entire network in response. If The Maze ever got ahold of those recordings, they could use it to topple corporations and governments.

## freeweb

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Vehemently against the tyranny of the mega-corps, FreeWeb seeks to dismantle the closed, protected communities of their networks, especially the Boardroom. FreeWeb members are often anti-modification as well, seeking to preserve what they see as the purity of the human genome. Visitors to FreeWeb’s network find themselves greeted by open meadows and lush forests. Anachronistically — at least as far as the look of the network goes — FreeWeb’s AI, Karlos, manifests as a young, athletic, dark-skinned industrial worker.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
Vesta, the second-largest asteroid in the Belt, is home to FreeWeb's public face. It's rumoured that the real power behind FreeWeb is elsewhere, somewhere that the megacorps can't find as easily.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Anarchist Confederacy, Independent System Media, Outer Rim Workers’ Initiative
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
FreeWeb is constantly recruiting members. It aims at those workers who feel that their contracts are not being honoured, or those who find themselves working in dangerous situations that could possibly be handled either remotely or by AI systems.
###### Adventurers
Anyone working for FreeWeb is probably being tasked with corporate sabotage or rescue of its members.
###### Allies
Just about the only major group that purports to care about the same things as FreeWeb is the Maze. Unfortunately, the methods of the two groups are almost complete opposites.
###### Enemies
FreeWeb would love nothing more than to see the Boardroom taken down. The official governmental networks (SecNet, Juzhen, Sunward Combine, and Worldweb) know that if that happened, their economies would fall apart, so they oppose FreeWeb as well.

```
```

<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/freeweb2_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;' />

###### History
FreeWeb was born out of the nearly endless Corporate Wars that preceded the space rush of the wormhole era. Nearly a billion people lost their lives from direct conflict and environmental damage before the wars proved too costly for even the mega-corps to continue. For some corporations, workers slowly began to force them into agreements that guaranteed their safety. Other corporations decided to simply replace those workers with robotic servants. Either way, there was plenty of fresh animosity toward the corporations for FreeWeb to take advantage of.
###### The True Danger
If FreeWeb and the Maze ever decided to work together, the corporate governments wouldn’t stand a chance. So far nothing’s tipped FreeWeb over the edge, but it probably wouldn’t take much.

## juzhen

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**In orbit around Jupiter is a massive swarm of self-sufficient miniature biospheres. Each one is completely autonomous, provided it stays within Juzhen's guidelines. The space around Jupiter is solely their domain, and the Orbital Enclave is the largest population group under one set of laws in the history of humanity. Overseeing all this is a new-generation AI — Zhao. Zhao appears in the traditional garb of an ancient Chinese general, and the virtual space he oversees is a full-scale Forbidden City.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
The city that criss-crosses Ganymede serves as Juzhen's powerbase, and is home to millions of Juzhen employees and those of its subsidiaries.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Open Sky Financial, TÍ Cloud Mining, Zhizhu Sichóu Fabrication|
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
Juzhen is a free frontier for those that want to live free from interference, with one caveat. Citizens are guaranteed the freedom to pursue whatever they wish within your personal habitats, as long as they back official Juzhen policies in public. Violations are punished harshly; some have led to habitats being ejected from orbit. There are generally no appeals.
###### Adventurers
Juzhen will usually hure freelancers for one of three reasons: Search & rescue (or detain) operations when a habitat goes off the grid, high-risk troubleshooting when a habitat is in danger, or eviction services when a hahitat is in violation.
###### Allies
The only network with a completely positive relationship with Juzhen is the Sunward Combine. Both know the neccessity of walking a tightrope to maintain their independence. Several treaties call one to arms if the other is ever threatened.
###### Enemies
The AI behind 4Space is jealous of the outsized power Zhao holds and will do almost anything to undermine its position. The Commune, Maze, and Nexus all hate Juzhen since it’s almost impossible to penetrate its citizens’ viewership.
```
```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/juzhen_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto' />

###### History
Even before the Great Diaspora from Earth, the old Chinese government was already exporting what was fast becoming its largest product: political dissidents. Once the idea was floated to ship them off Earth entirely, Juzhen was contracted to build the first orbital enclaves - essentially humane prisons where the dissidents could not communicate to spread their unrest. Corruption and unease inside the company itself led to Juzhen secretly relaxing restrictions, with the understanding that the dissidents not cause the company any problems. This agreement slowly evolved into the compact in effect in Juzhen today.
###### The True Danger
Juzhen's balancing act is a very precise one. Since residents are free to do what they want, Jupiter has become a favourite for criminals and terrorists — as long as they don't cause problems for Juzhen itself. So far, it hasn't been enough of a problem for any of the other networks to respond, but that could change all too easily.

## The Maze

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**There is no central repository for the Maze, which makes it unique from the other Networks. Instead it is hosted entirely on systems belonging to the other Networks, which means that there is no way to tell, upon visiting, whether you'll step into an opulent boardroom or the chapel of an ancient cathedral. The Maze's AI, too, is unpredictable. It rarely appears the same way twice, instead taking its appearance from random images stored online. Its voice is the only thing that remains constant, hoarse, raspy, and full of digital artifacts.**</div>

###### Center of Power
Just as there's no central repository for the Maze's data, there's no real location where the Maze's power is centralized. It's always hidden, always in motion.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Extinction Event, Black Moth Brotherhood, Red Ink Men
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
The maze is a huge black market, made up of a loose affiliation of crime families, gangs, malware creators, and mercenaries, all focused on one thing: wealth. To that end, they're willing to take on almost any job, as long as there's something in it for them. Almost every political and economic power pays the Maze for support or 'protection' whether they realize it or not.
###### Adventurers
Unknown faces are always welcome as smugglers, and those associated with the Maze often needs help freeing the shipments and sometimes even their members from detention.
###### Allies
If anyone could be said to be an ally of the Maze, it would be Flare, whose members often depend on the maze in order to maintain their lifestyle, despite what is actually legal in their locale.
###### Enemies
The Archive, being one of the oldest Networks, is taken advantage of by the Maze, and they do not take this lightly. There is constant conflict between the Archive's security forces and the maze's infiltrators in both real and cyberspace. The Boardroom too is a target of the Maze, since it is their shipping that is most often used for physical transports. This leads to similar conflicts with that Network.
```
```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/maze2_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;' />

###### History
The Maze is named for the sheer impossibility of tracking the people and goods that move through it's hands. It began life as a web of smugglers and gun-runners that helped secrete contraband onto outgoing colonial flights to Mars and Venus. As interplanetary flight increased, so too did the Maze. Some say that it's impossible to have a flight take off without the Maze using it to smuggle something or someone along with it. It's since branched out into other criminal enterprises now, and the economic might of the major players in the Maze is said to rival that of the largest megacorps.
###### The True Danger
Right now, the Maze isn't a huge danger because it's not organized. if someone ever managed to get all the various organizations on the same page, they would have immense power spread through every other Network, and might even be unstoppable.

## nexus

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Nexus is truly the system's go-to media source. Whether it's headlines, in-depth reporting, sports, reality TV, or full-immersion VR drama, if you're watching it, odds are that Nexus produces it — or pays someone else to do it for them. The Nexus' virtual world tries to recreate the golden days of the lost city of Los Angeles, from the fantastic vistas all the way down to the smog, it's all there. The AI that monitors and maintains the network, is a svelte blonde, said to be modelled after one of Earth's most beautiful ancient movie stars.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
A sprawling air-tight city dominates the Powehiwehi crater on Rhea, and in the middle of it all, the Nexus spire towers above everything, using it's vantage point around Saturn as a jumping off point to communicate with rest of the system.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
Jovian News Network, Brushstroke Media, Pure Reality Productions
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
Everyone with a link is familiar with Nexus. They’ve seen the logo plastered all over numerous award ceremonies, news subsidiaries, and sponsorship deals. They provide actual news, but digging into the lives of high-fliers is their favorite sport. Besides that, they sponsor their own celebrities as well, and their interactive TV hit, OREwell, which ships celebrities off to live together in cramped spaces in one of Earth’s oldest operational mines is well past its 100th season.
###### Adventurers
Adventurers working for the Nexus are usually either reporters, security for reporters, stunt people, or scouts sent to dangerous locations to make them safe for filming.
###### Allies
The Nexus doesn’t have many solid allies. They’ve been known to get cozy with every other network from time to time, but everyone knows that if the Nexus smells a story, the story is going out, alliances notwithstanding.
###### Enemies
The lynchpin of Juzhen's entire sociopolitical philosophy is the Privacy Restoration Act, so it's unsurprising that they're not a fan of the Nexus. There’s a good number of celebrities that keep second domiciles in Juzhen’s sphere of influence for that very reason. SecNet isn’t a big fan either; the military doesn’t want its secrets found out. The Commune claims not to have secrets, and when someone goes around trying to snoop, they’re often met with force.

```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/nexus_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto' />

###### History
The Nexus was one of the first purely infospace media organizations, born out of the need to keep colonists and asteroid miners entertained at all costs. As the non-earth population kept expending, so did the Nexus’ audience, and they now boast an audience of 7 billion devices that have at least one Nexus app installed, so that viewers can watch 25 televid stations, interact with over 50 VR streams, or listen to a back catalog of over ten million podcasts.
###### The True Danger
The Nexus collects information, but there are very strict about how it is used. In other words, they don't influence elections, don't try to topple governments, and don't try to unseat CEOs. But they could. All it would take was the right group to come to power and decades of information would become propaganda.

## secnet

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**When the Orison revealed themselves, the reaction of the majority of humankind hovered somewhere between curiousity and wariness. For the governments and corporations that formed SecNet though, outright alarm and hostility was the order of the day. SecNet is devoted to clearing the Orison out of the solar system, no matter the cost. SecNet's VR takes the shape of a military base, and it's AI is modelled off a industrial-age war hero, a brusque, take-no-flack army sergeant with an eye-patch and a cigar.**
</div>


###### Center of Power
SecNet HQ is an immense series of fortified tunnels connecting a labyrinth of man-made caverns buried beneath Olympus Mons on Mars.
###### Associated&nbsp;Groups
North American Union Expeditionary Force, Solar Guard, Near-Earth Defense Matrix
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
SecNet is both admired and feared by the populace of the solar system. Its admired because it ostensibly keeps the system safe from a full-fledged Orison takeover, but it is feared, because SecNet is willing to destroy an entire arcology dome if it means that an Orison infestation is wiped out too. There are also those who question whether the Orison are really the malevolent force that SecNet claims.
###### Adventurers
The war with the Orison is mostly cold now. Adventurers who work with SecNet will be sent against Orison targets considered too dangerous or too high-profile for the regular military to touch.
###### Allies
SecNet was born out of the powers of old Earth, so it's closest ally remains WorldWeb, but it owes much of its power to Juzhen and the SunWard Combine as well, so it tries to stay on good terms with them as well.
###### Enemies
SecNet's only declared enemy is the Orison, so it is obviously not friendly with the Commune, but it also has issues with Flare and Nexus, who both keep track of and highlight its missteps.

###### History
When the first Orison stepped out of a Mayan temple in the middle of an archaeological dig, the members of the now defunct United Worlds were alarmed. An immediate response was formed by Interplanetary Security Management Network to fight the apparent invasion, and as portals began to open around the world, the  grew in power. When portals were discovered on the Moon and on Mars, Secnet arrived to secure those locations and destroy the portals, and their power to seal sites and destroy alien tech of their own volition in now enshrined in law in many polities.
###### The True Danger
There's always a chance that a power-hungry leader may take over SecNet and decide that what the system really needs is a central government. The more overriding concern for some though is that sooner or later SecNet will do something that upsets the Orison so much that they'll just wipe the system clean instead of trying to spread their influence slowly.

## sunward combine

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**The Sunward Combine is a sovereign state formed from the union of Mercury and Venus. Most Network business is handled face-to-face, either via human or AI agents. There's no real VR to speak of, but on the rare occassion someone does gain access to it, they see a vast flat plain criss-crossed by gridlines, and are met by an AI of blinding brightness that speaks to the visitor from the middle of a bush.**
</div>

###### Center of Power
The very public center of the Combine's political and military power is the twin Forums of Worlds on Mercury and Venus.
###### Associated Groups
Autonomous Workers' Collective, The Crawling City, Demarchic People's Party
###### Common&nbsp;Knowledge
Everything on the the two planets is controlled by the neo-socialist Forum of Worlds, and all decisions are made democratically, one vote to every citizen that can prove comprehension. The Combine controls the vast majority of exotic mineral production in the system, giving it outsized leverage in industrial sectors. The Combine also has a sizable military to protect its industrial interests.
###### Adventurers
Adventurers might be brough to Combine worlds to protect production or to safeguard the political process.
###### Allies
Neither Juzhen nor the Combine are very friendly with the megacorps. The Combine provides humanitarian assistance for those still on Earth when needed.
###### Enemies
The Combine's anti-corp stance obviously puts the Boardroom on the opposite side of most conflicts. The Combine is very xenophobic too, which extends to the Commune. Flare is looked down on as a pointless luxury.

###### History
After a century of colonization, there were more native Venusians and Hermians than there were new arrivals, and they were tired of being taken advantage of. During a visit by the heads of Homeworld Limited, a rebel group seized control of the life support, water fabrication plants, and self-defense networks of both planets and took the corporate group hostage. After a year-long stand-off, the corporation was split into two parts. Homeworld Exports would stay corporation-owned and would get priority on export shipping. Sunward Combine would be owned by the workers, and would handle the mining permanently.
###### The True Danger
Many in the Combine think that they have leverage over the corps that need their raw materials, and most corps believe that. But there's a clause in the agreement between the workers and the corp that was signed all those years ago that almost no one knows about. If the Combine stops producing, they lose the legal right to live on their two planets. if that were to happen, there would be all-out war, and the rest of the system would suffer as the main supply of much-needed raw materials dried up.

## worldweb

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Old Earth is nearly deserted. Less than ten thousand people live in what was it's largest city; the entire population of Earth is approximately one million. Still, One, the AI that runs WorldWeb knows it is her duty to care for the remnant. Most of her time is taken up by arbitration between the last few remaining old-style governments. For this One invites the participants to a small, rather cheap-looking courtroom and takes the image of a short-haired, grandmotherly judge with a no-nonsense attitude.**
</div>

###### Center of Power
Earth is home to WorldWeb. Most of the Web is scattered across the face of North America in various sparsely-populated cities once home to millions.
###### Associated Groups
New York City Preservation Society, Interplanetary Archaeologist Association, The Eternal Shogunate
###### Common Knowledge
Worldweb was the original network, back when humans were confined on Earth. If you use it now, you're either one of the few that remain on earth or a very enthusiastic retrophile.
###### Adventurers
The Earth is home to many secrets, both ancient and new. You could be tasked with finding an Orison gateway or be sent to retreive a prototype weapon that was dumped on Earth for safekeeping.
###### Allies
4Space sees itself as an ally for Earth as long as it's convenient. SecNet has vowed to protect humanity's birthplace, at least as long as humanity lives there. Sunward sees the people of earth — those that are left — as oppressed as they once were, without real rights compared to the rest of the system, so they are eager to protect them. WorldWeb provides most the Archive's defenses since the Archive is right in the middle of WorldWeb geographically.
###### Enemies
X-Net isn't so much an outright enemy as it is just disdainful of Worldweb. Humans may have begun on Earth but as far as X-Net is concerned, they're through with it, and it should just be shut off to save resources. The Commune is continually probing Worldwebs' defenses, seeking to infiltrate it or take it over by brute force, but so far, they've bene unsuccessful. FreeWeb sees itself as WorldWeb 2.0, so there's really no reason for it to cooperate with WorldWeb.

###### History
WorldWeb began with ARPANET in the last half of the 20th century. By the 21st century it had evolved into the Internet and had become the premiere source of news and entertaintment, but it wasn't until Augmented Reality was commercialized that people were subject to the web every waking moment of their lives, and WorldWeb was born.
###### The True Danger
If WorldWeb falls, the Orison effectively control Earth. The Archive wouldn't be far behind, and once that fell, the system would descend into irreversible chaos.

## X-NET

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**The intrepid men and women (and squids and A.I.) of X-Net would describe themselves as the most forward-looking of those in the system, seeking to find new worlds before the inevitable destruction of Earth. X-Net's VR sim is a vast starfield, and the A.I. that greets those that enter is not an A.I. at all, but an uplifted giant raven named Thor who chose to be uploaded into the Network for just that purpose.**
</div>

###### Center of Power
Sedna, beyond the Kuiper Belt is home to X-Net's headquarters. The minor planet has been hollowed out over the years, and the HQ now measures over 200 km in diameter.
###### Associated Groups
Alpha Centauri Preparatory Group, Farsearch, First Contact Potential Adivsory 
###### Common Knowledge
X-Net is working on finding the next Earth via gate jumps. So far, suitable planets have been in short supply, and they have yet to find a passable substitute.
###### Adventurers
Adventurers working for X-Net are likely escorting new equipment out to Sedna or jumping through a gate to an unknown world. In addition to that, and in spite of X-Net's outward-bound policy, a lot of politics have to happen inside the system. X-Net often needs help encouraging aothers to see things their way.
###### Allies
SecNet looks as X-Net as an outgrowth of itself, an insurance policy in case the Orison cannot be driven out of the system.
###### Enemies
X-Net views WorldWeb as outmoded, uneccesary, and deliberately undermining it's interest in helping humans supercede the solar system. The Commune is of course it's main enemy since it is the reason they're trying to leave in the first place. The Archive is an enemy too, though only obliquely. X-Net would love to get its hands on all the patented tech protected by the Archive.

```
<img src='http://worldtree.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/4/7/14473916/x-net_orig.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto' />

###### History
X-Net was founded by a senior general in SecNet that felt that the fight against the Orison was doomed. X-Net was founded on sending 'expendables' such as criminals and unstable individuals on exploratory missions, but currently uses volunteers from many diferent sources.
###### The True Danger
X-Net doesn't plan on just leaving. In their travels they have found an ancient device called by those who created it the Bringer of Darkness. They're going to set it off near the sun once they've found a stable home elsewhere. They seem to think that will solve the Orison problem once and for all.

## character creation

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The core of Void Age is a system a lot of players will already be familiar with: d20. That means character creation will be familiar. There are a few new things though, as follows:**
- <p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom:0px'>**Both your sheath and class give you bonuses. This makes it easier to make a viable character.**
- <p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom:0px'>**Long skill lists (and all the math that goes with them) are gone. Instead, you gain backgrounds. These are broad areas that are grounded in your character's story. When one is relevant, you get a bonus.**
- <p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom:0px'>**Every character has a unique trait that helps the GM make your game about your characters.**
- <p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Your character has a reputation which affects his relationship with the major players in the setting.**</div>

### Creation Checklist
To make a character, you'll need to do each of these things. More info on each step follows this list.
- **Talk about the setting.** Void Age is meant to be customized, so make sure you know what type of story your GM is planning.
- **Choose a sheath.** In Void Age, people regularly transfer their conciousness to other forms, called sheaths. You'll get to pick an ability bonus from your sheath. You can also change sheaths when you gain a new level. 
- **Choose a class.** Your class also gives you a bonus to an ability, one that will be useful. You'll also need to choose a few powers. 
- **Generate ability scores.** You'll have 12 points to spend on your ability scores. Unlike some other d20 games, you don't have a separate score and modifier. The numbers you'll be buying are what you might be used to seeing as your modifier.
- **Calculate your combat stats.** Calculate your basic attack bonuses and damage, power bonuses and damage, Dodge, Fortitude, Willpower, hit points, and Initiative.
- **Choose your unique trait.** Come up with something that is unique to your character. This doesn't affect mechanics, but it can affect the story. 
- **Choose your Network reputations.** Describe your character’s reputation with the various Networks.
- **Design your backgrounds.** Your character has at least eight background points that you can use to explain why your character is good at what he is.
- **Choose a feat.** You can choose one feat at first level. It can be a general feat or one that's tied to one of your class features, talents, or powers.
- **Describe your starting gear, and purchase new gear.** Specify the sort of weapons, armor, and other gear that your character has.

```
```

### Ability Scores
All Ability Scores start at -2. You can add 12 points to your scores in any combination, to a maximum of +4. (Sheath and Class choices can still raise these later.)

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>| |
|:---|:---:|:---|
|**Strength**|**ST**|Innate power and physical training.|
|**Dexterity**|**DX**|Coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance.|
|**Constitution**|**CN**|Health, toughness, and stamina.|
|**Intelligence**|**IN**|Ease of learning, breadth of knowledge, reasoning ability.|
|**Wisdom**|**WS**|Common sense, perception, and intuition.|
|**Charisma**|**CH**|Personality, persuasiveness, and attractiveness.|</div>

### SHEATH
Choose your character’s Sheath from the list below.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>| |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Android**|**Bion**|**Flitter**|
|**Fury**|**Ghost**|**Mentat**|
|**Myriad**|**Octon**|**Recovered**|
|**Silver**|**Skav**|**Unsheathed**|</div>

Each sheath provides a +1 bonus to one of your ability scores. This isn’t a permanent choice, but can be changed when you level up while you’re in a major hub.

### CLASS
Next, select your character's class.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>| |
|---|
|**Adepts** eschew high technology, choosing to rely on their innate skill.|
|**Deadeyes** are deadly snipers, and experts in close-quarter combat.|
|**Gatekeepers** use the power of wormholes to make allies mobile and trap enemies.|
|**The Glitch** breaks the laws of physics to be wherever she wants, when she wants.|
|**Junkers** are at home in the ruins of civilization, travelling with an animal or mechanical pet.|
|**Nebulas** use nanites to heal and boost allies' abilities while hindering enemies.|
|**The Phage** is a walking pathogen and infects enemies to slow them down.|
|**Psiblades** wield weapons forged from their minds.|
|**Vectors** rip apart reality and reform it in ways that benefit them.|
|**Zerkers** burn up their cybernetic enhancements to perform superhuman acts.|</div>

Each class also provides a +1 bonus to one of your ability scores along with a +1 to one defense.

### Secondary STATS
For details on how combat works, see the Combat chapter.

#### HIT POINTS
Find the base value for your class (6, 7, or 8) in the Class Listing and add your CN.
Multiply your base hit points by your level modifier.

###### Hit Points Level Modifier
<div style='column-count:2; -webkit-column-gap: 10px;'>

|Level|Modifier|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|3|
|2|4|
|3|5|
|4|6|
|5|8|

|Level|Modifier|
|:---:|:---:|
|6|10|
|7|12|
|8|16|
|9|20|
|10|24|

</div>

```
```

#### Defenses
Each character has three defense scores.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Dodge** defends against ranged attacks.|
|**Fortitude** defends against melee attacks and area attacks.|
|**Willpower** defends against mental attacks, or effects that try to mislead you.|</div>

Your Defense scores are the total of your **class bonus**, **sheath bonus**, and **level**, plus the **middle value of three of your ability scores**.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
|||
|:---:|---|
|**Dodge**|class bonus + sheath bonus + level + the middle score of **DX//IN//WS**|
|**Fortitude**|class bonus + sheath bonus + level + the middle score of **ST//DX//CN**|
|**Willpower**|class bonus + sheath bonus + level + the middle score of **IN//WS//CH**|</div>

#### INITIATIVE//Awareness
Your Initiative bonus is your DX + your level, plus any other bonuses from feats or powers. When you make an Initiative check, you roll 1d20 and add all these modifiers.

Your Awareness bonus is your DX + your level, plus any other bonuses from feats or powers. When you make an Awareness check, you roll 1d20 and add any modifiers.

<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
|Initiative|Awareness|
|:---:|:---:|
|DX + level|WS + level|</div>

#### RECOVERIES
Most characters start the game with 8 recoveries. (See Recoveries.) Some classes and talent choices may give you more recoveries.

Each class also has a different recovery die, usually a d6, d8, or d10, as specified in the class write-up. When you roll a recovery, you’ll roll a number of recovery dice equal to your level and add your CN.

#### ATTACKS//POWERS
You calculate attack and damage rolls based on the ability scores favored by your class or by the specific powers you choose within your class. Most classes use one specific ability score for most of their attacks. See Classes for more information.

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

### REPUTATIONS
Your character has a relationship with at least one Network, and often with several. These relationships connect characters to the game world. A Network may have its own advocates and soldiers (including you) to advance its cause in the game world.

#### REPUTATION POINTS
At 1st level, each character gets 3 reputation points. These points represent your leverage with your chosen Network. As the game continues, your relationships may change. You may gain more relationships or lose a relationship altogether. Just remember, unless something tells you that you can have more, three points is the maximum for any one network.

The number of points you invest in a reputation with an Network doesn’t necessarily correlate with the closeness of the connection or the strength of the relationship. It does correlate with the utility of the reputation. It’s not necessarily about how well the Network knows you or how strong the Network feels about you. Instead, the points reflect the chance that your reputation will be helpful to you.

#### REPUTATION TYPES
Not all relationships are created equal. You may choose to be friendly with a Network, work for another one, and be the target of a third. When you choose with Network to have a relationship with, also choose the type of relationship that it is.

##### POSITIVE
As far as the Network is concerned, you’re one of the good guys, a white-hat hero. Their authorities often help you, and civilians aligned with the network trust you. On the down side, you may be called on to run jobs for the Network even when you have other plans.

However, while you're liked by people associated with this network, you've also almost invariably made enemies. You might also be a target of the Network's enemies or rivals. Opportunities, advantages, complications, and hazards will come from those at odds with this Network.

You might also be able to gain secrets or allies from this Network, but if opposing networks see you operating openly with a network they dislike, you could run into trouble with them.

##### CONFLICTED
For some reason you’re suspect to the Network. Maybe you’re a convict who has served his time, or an soldier who was too good and got drummed out of his unit. You have insider knowledge and allies who are aligned with the Network but you also have enemies there.

```
```

Your reputation with the Network is complex and spotty since their motives are sometimes questionable to you. One way or another, you can find help or hostility anywhere. You don’t just live in interesting times — you create them. It's also possible that you used to belong to the Network but don't anymore. Maybe you didn’t see eye to eye — and they don’t look to kindly on anyone that they consider to be a traitor.

Your remaining connections might allow you unique insight into the group, but it also makes you suspect in the eyes of anyone still aligned with the Network.

##### NEGATIVE
In the eyes of the Network, you’re a rival, a dissident, or an opponent. You may have inside knowledge or even inside men that you can use to your advantage, but trouble awaits you wherever this Network has influence.

Your bad rep with this Network makes you some enemies, but as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so it makes you friends of a sort as well. You may also still have a connection to the network that  gives you special knowledge or contacts.

#### Adjusting REPUTATIONS
Each level, you can switch an existing reputation point from one Network to another, including to a new Network. Make sure to give the GM and other players an entertaining explanation of what this big change represents for your character.

At Champion Tier (5th level) you gain an extra reputation point. Use it to increase an existing reputation by one die (to a maximum of 3) or gain a new 1-point reputation with a new Network that matches your character’s story.

At Epic Tier (8th level) you gain another reputation point, which you can use to increase an existing Network reputation by one die, with no maximum.

#### REPUTATION DICE
To check your Network Reputation (your relationship with a particular Network), roll a d6 for each point you have in the relationship. This will usually be 1, 2, or 3 dice, but it could be more!

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:20px'>
| |
|---|
|For each 6 that you roll. you get some meaningful advantage from the relationship without having complications.|
|For each 5, your connection to the Network is going to work out as well as a 6 would, but with some unexpected complication. You might be drawn into some obligation or attract unwanted attention.|
|Rolling 5s when you also rolled 6s should make life both interesting and advantageous!|</div>

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

### BACKGROUNDS
Backgrounds represent pieces of your character’s history that contributes to your character’s history as well as their ability to succeed with non-combat skills. These are broad categories of experience (cat burglar, for example) rather than specific implementations of that experience (climbing and hiding). Backgrounds don’t sync to any specific ability score.

**To the players:** Not every problem can be solved by your dominant abilities. Use your backgrounds to roleplay and find creative solutions to problems.

**To the GM:** Make all of the ability scores matter at one time or another.

#### BACKGROUND POINTS
Each character gets 8 background points, plus any extra that a class awards. Assign your background points to as many backgrounds as you want, up to your total points. You can assign a maximum of 5 points to a single background (and minimum of 1).

#### HOW TO CHOOSE
Choose backgrounds that help you make sense of your characters past, jobs, and settings. Background and skill use is meant to be about fun in-character methods of attempting to advance the plot.

Possible backgrounds include: assassin, belt miner, chef, con-woman, corporate spy, environmental cleaner, ex-mercenary, derelict salvager, genome architect, hunted outlaw, megacorp lawyer, orison acolyte, reality star, refugee, research scientist, secure courier, scout, system-wide pop-star, uplifted animal, zero-G mechanic, zone cleaner, and so on.

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

OPTION: FLEXIBLE BACKGROUNDS</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

With this rule, you can move one point from one current background to another each time you gain a level. You can even swap the point into an entirely new background as long as you explain how it fits the story.

</div>

</div>

```
```

### ONE UNIQUE THING
Your character’s One Unique Thing (OUT) is a special feature invented by you, the player, which sets your character apart from every other hero. It is a unique and special trait to your player, and markedly unusual. The intent is that it provides a special flavor to the campaign and can assist the GM in determining how your character can interact with characters and story in the campaign.

#### Things to Include
**Story effects** are what a good OUT is all about. Your OUT should have an effect on the world, but it should be part of the story, not part of the rules. The GM should be able to use your OUT as a plot point, so give him something that would make a difference to the world, not something that tries to change a rule.

Your OUT should **give hints** of where yoru character is headed. Your OUT works best when it not only shows the past, but hints at the future. Your character will change as you play through a campaign, and unexpected things may impact your OUT. Try to make an OUT that can change too. There is one warning though. Powers you might get as a result of your OUT should be a surprise to you, and should arise out of the story, not because you declared you would have it someday.

**Tie your OUT in with your reputations.** It helps your character make sense to have your OUT point to the reputations you pick.

#### Things to Avoid
Your OUT should **not** be centered around, or provide value for coombat. If you need to ask 'Can I use my OUT here?' you're approaching this wrong.

If your OUT does seem like it could only be handled as a power, it should be a power that the GM can use, and that opens up changes to RP. Do you talk to computers? The computers say what the GM wants them to say. Can you detect lies? Maybe you get **every** lie that people say, including ones that make you uncomfortable.

### FEATS
**Characters choose one feat per level.**

Feats appear in three tiers — Adventurer, Champion, and Epic and are available as shown below.

###### Feat Availability
|Levels|Total Feats|
|---|---|
|**1-4**|Adventurer|
|**5-7**|Adventurer or Champion|
|**8-10**|Adventurer, Champion, or Epic|

Most feats in the game are attached to specific class talents or powers. If a feat is attached to a specific power, you must have that ability in order to choose the feat.

When you select a new feat, you must choose the lowest Tier available if you have not already chosen that one.

#### GENERAL FEATS
Most feats are tied directly to classes. You can find details on these as part of the class writeups.

There are, though, a few general feats available to any character. A character can’t take a specific feat more than once. Some general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion-tier and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.

###### Combat Technique
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You can make melee attacks with Dexterity if you'd normally use Strength, or Strength if you'd normally use Dexterity.|
|**Champion Feat:** You can make ranged attacks with Intelligence if you'd normally use Dexterity or with Wisdom if you'd normally use Intelligence.|
|**Epic Feat:** Choose to make either melee attacks or ranged attacks with the ability score that gets a boost from your class.|
</div>

###### Extra BACKGROUNds
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You gain 2 extra background points to spend on new or existing backgrounds up to the 5-point-per-background maximum.|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain 3 more extra background points to spend on new or existing backgrounds up to the 5-point-per-background maximum.|
|**Epic Tier:** You gain 2 more extra background points to spend on new or existing backgrounds up to a  maximum of 7.|
</div>

```
```

###### Extra TOUGh
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>

|**Adventurer Feat:** Add +1 to your HP Modifier. This increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +4 at 8th level.|
</div>

###### IMPROVED INITIATIVE
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks.|
|**Champion Feat:** Before rolling Initiative, select one enemy. If your Initiative is higher than that enemy's Initiative, that enemy is Vulnerable to you until the escalation die reaches 3.|
|**Epic Feat:** If your natural Initiative roll is less than 11, you can spend a recovery to make it 11.|
</div>

###### LINGUIST
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You speak any commonly-known language enough to comprehend what most people are saying or screaming during battle. You aren't fluent, and no one will mistake you for a native speaker. Your vocabulary leans toward tactics and danger, rather than emotions. You can also read basic danger signs in all these languages.|
|**Champion Feat:** You are fluent in all common languages. Stranger languages are harder, but if someone is speaking it, you can figure it out.|</div>

###### PRECISE SHOT
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Your ranged attacks never have a chance to hit allies.|
</div>

###### REACH TRICKS
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per battle, tell the GM how you are performing an unexpected stunt with a reach weapon such as a smartspear or energy whip. To succeed, you must roll a 6+ on a d20.|
</div>

###### SKILL ESCALATION
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Twice per day, after you see the result of a check, you can add the escalation die to the result.|
</div>

###### STRONG RECOVERY
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** When you roll recovery dice, reroll one of the dice and use the higher result. At level 5, reroll two of the dice. At level 8, reroll three.|

### GEAR
Every character has a set of gear. The class listings use the categories below to show which types of armor and weapons each class is proficient with, and the damage they deal. See the individual classes for details. You can equip non-prototype gear as your backgrounds and character history suggest.

#### ARMOR
Armor protects you from attacks. It raises one defense. The defense that is raised will depend on your class. Armor is classified as either light or heavy. Light armor includes padded clothes, leather armor, and aerogel impact dampeners. Heavy armor includes graphene plate, fusion-smelted carapace, diamondoid armor, and zeroplating.

#### WEAPONS
Every weapon deals one type of damage, selected when the weapon is created. Weapons that characters start with at level one are kinetic weapons — weapons that deal physical damage via impact. These are still the most easily available, even if they use superdense materials and fire smart projectiles instead of bullets. Prototype weapons — both melee and ranged — deal other types of damage.

With the nearly infinite types of weaponry that could be created in Void Age we haven't tried to give you a comprehensive list of weapons. You can describe your weapons any way you want to, but the GM has the final word on what category a weapon falls under.

##### MELEE WEAPONS
Melee weapons remain in common use, especially among the less affluent orbital communities and drifter hubs, where a badly-placed shot could spell the end of an entire habitat. Most weapons now are grown from graphene nanotubes, fusion-smelted, or zeroed.

###### Simple Melee Weapons
<div style='margin-top:-5px'>
| |

#### Armor//Weapon TEch
Numerous technologies exist throughout the system. Even attempting a comprehensive list is probably not possible, since new proprietary techniques and materials are being developed. However, in general, these are the most prevalently used processes.

##### AEROGEL
Aerogel is not formed with any one specific material, but is a blanket term for any synthetic porous ultralight material. When the liquid component of a gel is replaced with a gas, the result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity.

Aerogel is commonly known as frozen smoke owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. To the touch, it doesn’t feel like much more than a sponge or styrofoam, but with advanced materials as the starting point, Void Age aerogels are capable of stopping impacts from powerful weapons.

##### DIAMONDOID
Diamondoid armor is crafted from the carbon cage molecules, created by using nanotechnology to form the cages as small as possible. The cages are linked first in a chain, then in sheet, and folded until at the needed strength.

By layering diamondoid sheets, a very compact material is made, suitable for both personal armor and heat-shielding on re-entry vehicles. As a result of the process, many diamondoid armors have a glassy appearance.

```
```

##### FUSION-SMELTING
Fusion-smelting results in much denser metals than previously possible. In basic terms, heavy elements are flash-melted, and combined before being molded. The result is much stronger, but also much heavier metals.

The current favorite is randium, so named after the series of random tests run by Poseidon Autonetics that resulted in the destruction of thirty four of their orbital laboratories. Randium is able to match graphene in it’s extremely high melting point. In fact, in the current Void Age, disposal of fusion-smelted items can only be done by launching them into the sun.

##### GRAPHENE
Graphene is the most common building material for most things in Void Age. Graphene is an allotrope of carbon, and begins growing as a single sheet of interlinked molecules.

It is molded or sprayed into exactly the form required for everything from spacecraft frames to priming charges. Graphene can be metallic or magnetic, or both, depending on how it is grown, and has a melting point which approaches the sun’s surface temperature.

##### ZEROING
At temperatures approaching absolute zero, some metals bond so tightly that it is not even possible to tell that there were ever two pieces.

Using this technique, weapons, armor, and even some spacecraft are essentially 3d-printed at extremely low temperatures, causing the components used to fuse into one nearly unbreakable piece. While not always as heat-resistant as other methods, this provides great tensile strength.

## Playing the Game

<p style='font-size:13.5px; padding-bottom: 30px'>**Playing a roleplaying game is basically creating a story with the GM and the players. The GM sets the stage, tells the players what they see, provides a world for adventures. The players react to that world, so the world changes. The GM describes the changes, the players react, so so on. A later chapter goes into detail on how the Gamemaster should handle his part in the story. This chapter is what you'll need to know as a player so you can help create more interesting, lively games.**</div>

### Drama First
It's easy to assume that the best solution is the safest or most efficient one. The problem with keeping yourself out of danger though, is that nothing exciting happens when you're safe. If there's ever a choice between debating for half an hour about the best way to do something, or just doing something cool, the best bet is probably just doing something fun and seeing what happens. Remember, the GM can't tell you what happens next if the characters never do anything. In other words, don't just think about what makes the most sense; think about what seems cool instead.

Think about the following scenario: Your group is on a interplanetary flight that has been sabotaged. There are escape pods, so from yoru character's point of view, the most logical thing would be to just hop in one and jettison yourself. If you do though, is that exciting? Not exactly. Instead, maybe they can rush to get other passengers into the pods or try to fix the sabotage. Both generate more drama than simply jumping ship.

This doesn't mean though that you should try to do everything or go in random directions without consulting your team. Your team depends on you to make things interesting, not to cause problems.

```
```

### Don't Keep Secrets
When you're describing your next steps to your GM, don't try to hide why you want to do what you want to do. While it's true that in many RPGs it's almost a virtue to be secretive when you're asking your GM questions so that he doen't know why you want to know, that's not the case in Void Age. In Void Age, the GM's job is not to figure out how to trip you up, or block your plans. It's not even his job to always tell you what makes the most sense in the context of the game world.

Like you, the GM is trying to create a good story, so when you ask for information, tell the GM what you hope to find out, and why. The more information your give when you're asking a question, the more the GM can give you an answer that's interesting.

Instead of asking, "How far is the Orison temple?" you could say, "I want to investigate the temple to find out how long it's been since it was used." With the first question, the GM might just say, oh, it's a few hours away to the south. There's not much information exchanged, because you didn't ask for much. With the second question though, the GM knows that the temple is central to your interests, so he might say, "It's on the other end of the city, but it's shielded. You'll need to convince a local worshipper to take you in there." Instead of getting there and finding out you need to come back to search for help, you know it ahead of time.

### SKILL CHECKS
Even though an RPG is a cooperative story, occassionally, there's times when just talking doesn't When you roll a skill check to find out if you succeed at a task or trick, the GM tells you which ability score is being tested. Then you choose the background you think is relevant to gain the points you have in that background as a bonus to the skill check.

Most skill checks require you to equal or beat a Difficulty Class (DC), set by the environment you are operating in, to succeed.

To make a skill check, roll a d20 and add:

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:25px'>| |
|:---:|
|**one** ability mod + level + **one** background|</div>

#### Choosing a Background
You can only apply one background to a skill check. For instance, a character is outnumbered and faces a choice. He must hold out or flee. He has two backgrounds: Army Veteran (+3) and Gang Runner (+4).

Each of those backgrounds probably included very differant training for this situation. Army discipline makes him want to hold out and wait for reinforcements. His time in a gang, though, might remind him that there's no guarantee that help will come so he should get away while he can. The choice he makes in the end will determine which background he can add to his roll. 

#### Check MODIFIERS
The universal check modifier is +2 when you have advantageous circumstances.

Similarly, –2 is the right penalty for adverse situations.

#### TRIUMPHS//FUMBLES
When a PC rolls a natural 20 with a skill check, the character triumphs, and the GM should give that character much more success than the player expected.

When a PC rolls a 1 with a skill check, the skill check fumbles and fails, perhaps in a particularly bad way. But a failure isn’t always entirely terrible.

##### FAILING FORWARD
Outside of battle, failure can tend to slow action down rather than move it along. Try to interpret failure as an event that happens to carry unwanted consequences or side effects. The character probably still achieves the desired goal, but there's a problem along the way. 

For instance, suppose you suspect that electronic records have been altered, so you want to go to one of the Archive's central libraries to research the physical records. If you succeed at your check, you've found the information you're looking for. If you fail, you're ambushed in the library by someone hoping to prevent you from getting the information. You're able to finish your search only after defeating the ambush.

```
```

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

option: check failures</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Traditionally, when a player fails a check, the GM narrates why the check failed. This rule turns that on its head. If it were a real situation, who would be in the best position to know why the attempt failed? The person attempting the action, obviously. So, when a player fails a check, ask them to tell you why it failed, if it seems reasonable to do so. Then, based on their answer, take the story from there.

For instance, a player is attempting to sneak into a secure area. he fails his check. If he fails it due to running around a corner into a gaurd, the consequences would be much different than if he fell off a catwalk. In each case, the attempt has obviously failed, but the former possibly leads to a fight while the latter can be treated as a hazard.

</div>

</div>

### INSIGHT
As game runners – and as players – sometimes it’s hard to tell what will be difficult and what won't. The GM might think he’s devised a fiendish puzzle and the players finish it immediately. On the other hand, the GM thinks that things are simple and they turn out to be very complicated from the players’ point of view.

When the players are too much in the dark it can affect both game progression and enjoyment. And that’s where Insight comes in. Insight is your character’s ability to figure out – whether through speaking to people associated with the story or by analyzing clues – just what he should be doing next. This doesn’t mean that the GM is going to spill the plot to you, but you will get a good next step if successful.

When you use Insight, roll a d20 and add… 

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:15px'>
| |
|---|
|... IN if you examine clues related to the story.|
|... CH if you ask around for leads.|</div>

On a success, the Narrator will tell you which locations or people to check out next. He might give you a few options, and there’s no guarantee you’ll pick the best one, but you’ll have somewhere to go. On a failure, following the principle of failing forward, you’ll also get a location or person to check out, but it will be dangerous for you.

<div class='footchtxty'>CHARACTERS</div>

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

#### FLEXIBLE POWERS
Player characters are able to apply their unique skills to any task. This includes using psionic or technological powers outside of combat. If a combat power has a potential use outside combat, with the GM’s approval, you can use it in a new way.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:15px'>
| |
|---|
|If it’s an at-will power, it can’t be used again until your next battle.|
|If it’s an Encounter power, it can’t be used again until the end of the next battle.|
|Daily powers can’t be used again until the end of a long rest, as normal.|</div>

If you need to produce an effect that can’t reasonably be done by your own innate powers, or if the effect you want to produce is very complicated or powerful, you can possibly use a Large-Scale Power.

##### COMPLEX POWER USE
A player may come up with an approach that uses the team's powers in a very unique way. When a player wants to do this, our advice is to let them go for it. 

###### For the Player
First, you need to tell the GM what you're trying to accomplish and make any preparations the GM deems neccesary. This could result in extra tasks as you gather needed components or make other preparations.

Next, choose a power or powers that will help you to accomplish the task. The higher the level of the power used in the process, the greater the effect. The power is expended as soon as you start this process. If you don’t have an appropriate power, whoever is leading the effort can spend two Recoveries.

Finally, you need to spend the time required to actually attempt the task. It might range from a few minutes to break into a security system to a few hours to build a special device. You can’t activate other powers during this period. Remember though, the rest of the world, including potential enemies, are still active during all this. A PC taking damage won’t necessarily end the process, but it will be ruined if a character falls unconscious or launches an attack of their own.

After the time needed has passed, make a skill check using one of your backgrounds and the ability score the GM deems appropriate. 

```
```

###### For the GM
When you set the DC for the complex power, use the standard DC targets, depending on your tier and the results the player is hoping to achieve.

Make the outcome show up as an outgrowth of the power’s normal effects. The effects don’t have to play within the usual constraints of the system, and they don’t have to be taken as a precedent for future attempts. If the attempt fails, it should still advance the plot somehow (see Failing Forward).

### Purchasing Items
Reputation is currency in Void Age, and your identity is your bank. The cryptocurrency craze of the twentieth century was the foundation for Zhàng Securident to birth a new form of financial surety. Backed by both the Archive and the Boardroom, the Central Services Exchange is a virtual trading floor when services of all types are valued and traded among the megacorps.

When you buy something from someone, you digitally sign a gaurantee to render an equal amount of service in return, based on the current CSE rates. If your seller doesn't need those services, they'll probably list them on the Exchange. The Exchange tracks the worth of these gaurantees in Zhàng (Ẕ). One thousand Zhàng is 1kẔ, and one million is 1kkẔ. if you have a good reputation, your gaurantees will be worth more; if you're not reliable, though, your personal worth takes a hit. 

To attempt to purchase an item, make a **Purchase Check** vs. the **Purchase DC**.

To make a Purchase check, roll a d20, modify it as follows, and compare it to the Purchase DC.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>
| |
|:---:|
|1d20 + Reputation + Training + Trade-In + Currency|</div>

<div style='margin-top:-20px'>
|vs|
|:---:|
|Rarity - Relevance + Legality|</div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: Shop Around</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

It might not always be necessary to rely on the vagaries of the market. If you use Shop Around in your game, you can spend extra time to shop (usually a day or two) and get something plain, or average quality, that does only what you need it to do.

When you Shop Around, don’t roll the d20. Use a base of 10, and add any additional dice and modifiers.

<div class='footchy'></div>

<div class='footchtxty'>CHARACTERS</div>

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

#### Purchase Check Modifiers
The Purchase Check is modified by your Reputation, your training with the item in question, and whether you have anything to trade or currency to use.

##### Reputation
Roll any reputation dice you have with the network from which you're attempting to purchase.

##### Training
If one of your backgrounds gives you reason to be trained with the item you’re trying to purchase, add your background points to the Purchase roll.

##### Trade-In
Rare or Prototypes can be traded in; add 1d6 per item to your roll.

##### Currency
Spending 100Ẕ will add a +1 to your roll if it's for common items, and spending 1kẔ will add a +1 to your roll if the item you're after is rare or restricted. Other PCs can also add their Zhang to your purchase attempt if they wish.

#### Purchase DC Modifiers
The Purchase DC is based on the rarity of the item, and modified by the item's relevance to your current objective, and the local legality of the item.

##### Rarity
Use the Environmental skill check base as the base DC.
<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>
| | |
|:---|:---|
|Common or inexpensive items|Normal|
|Uncommon or expensive items|Hard|</div>

Different locations will have different rarities. For instance, the availability of weapons will be different in an earthside agrarian complex than it will be in a mega-corp security orbital.

##### Relevance
If an item is obviously useful for a mission assigned by the network you’re using to purchase the item, lower the DC by 1. If not having it would make accomplishing the mission etremely difficult, lower the DC by 2.

##### Legality
If an item needs a license or is restricted (e.g. military grade, or proprietary tech), raise the DC by 2. If an item is illegal, raise the DC by 4.

```
```

#### Purchase Check Results
If you succeed on your purchase check, you’ve found the item exactly as you wanted it, at a price you can afford.

If you fail on your purchase check, you still get the item, but it's either not in good condition, or it's more costly than anticipated. Choose one of the following options (or an alternative that your GM presents):

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|Pay 1kẔ x the difference between the Purchase DC and your Purchase Roll.|
|Change a Positive reputation point to Conflicted with the same Network.|
|Change a Conflicted reputation point to Negative with the same Network.|
|Settle for something not really as good as what you’re looking for. This might be something in bad condition, something that could not work as intended, or has other strings attached, such as being stolen.|
|Agree to work for the Network.|</div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

After Failing a Purchase Check</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

There's one more thing that's very important to note about failing a Purchase check, and that's why we're putting it in this nice shiny box.

If you settle for something that's not quite what you want, you've just let that vendor know you don't have much money. If you change reputation points or have to agree to work for the vendor, you've just gone into debt with them.

Either way, they're probably not going to sell you anything else.</div></div>

#### Purchase DC List
Some items have a listed DC. When purchasing one of these items, use the listed DC instead of the rarity. The listed DC is still modified for relevancy and legality.

Characters start with armor, weapons, and standard traveling gear; prices are included for reference. DCs use environmental skill check DCs as their base, and will be listed as Normal, or Hard, sometimes along with a modifier (e.g. Normal +2).

The following list is not meant to be exhaustive, but just to give the GM a point of reference for whatever is needed.

<div class='footchy'></div>

<div class='footchtxty'>CHARACTERS</div>

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

##### Consumable Prices
Items on the gear list are either obviously usable more than once, such as clothes, weapons, or backpacks, or consumable, like meals. When it comes to paying for consumable items, it's probably not a good idea to make characters make a check for every meal. In general, these prices are provided for those times when the characters need to get into a specific establishment for some plot-related event.

If you're going to purchase more than a few of these items, or if you're going to use these services for an extended period of time, instead of making a roll for each day, we suggest making one roll, modifying it as follows:
- If you're purchasing more than two uses or two days of service, but less than a five, add +2 to the roll.
- If you're purchasing up to ten uses or up to ten days of service, add +5 to the roll.

###### Assistance
The price for assistance includes any gear and provisions they need, including gear needed to control an animal.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|**Jumpgate**|Planetary<br>Interplanetary|Hard&nbsp;+1<br>Hard&nbsp;+3|

###### Toolkits
Instead of buying each individual piece of equipment you might need separately, you can purchase toolkits. A toolkit is **not** a list of items. A toolkit **is** whatever you need for a specific type of task. If you don't have the gear for a particular task, apply the universal check modifier for negative circumstances: -2.  

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
|Item|Base DC|
|---|:---|
|**Artisan Kit**|Normal +3|
|**Climbing Kit**|Normal +1|
|**Demolitions Kit**|Normal +2|
|**Disguise Kit**|Normal +1|
|**Electronics Kit**|Normal +2|
|**Foresnsic Kit**|Normal +3|
|**First Aid Kit**|Normal|
|**Mechanics Kit**|Normal|
|**Security Kit**|Normal +1|
|**Survival Kit**|Normal|</div>

If you don't see a toolkit that fits your needs, ask your GM to suggest one that will work, or to make one for you.

## Sheathes

Even as early as the 2oth century, body modification was a possibility, although it remained something of a niche culture until the advent of active genemods that could edit people even in adulthood. When memory engrams were proven workable, the technology took the next logical step. Now, resheathing is as common as purchasing a new home.

Every PC chooses a sheath — or, if the character wishes to remain pure human, they can remain unsheathed. (See the listing for Unsheathed on page XX.)

### Biot

#### Gaia's Gift
Once per day, you or a nearby ally may spend a recovery to heal once on the turn that you use Gaia's Gift, and once on your following turn.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|**Adventurer Feat:** Gaia's Gift grants additional healing equal to your Charisma on each heal.|
|**Epic Feat:** Gaia's Gift targets all allies, as long as you're somehow aware of their presence.|</div>

#### Rooted
Once per day, when you are not already Stuck, you may choose to become Rooted. When you do, you become Stuck, but you are also immune to Confuse, Daze, Fear, Stun, and other Stuck effects besides Rooted. You can make an immediate save against each of these effects that already affect you. You can end your Stuck condition when you wish, and all immunities given by Rooted end along with it.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|**Adventurer Feat:** For each round that you remain Rooted after the first, roll 1d20. On a roll of 11+, a small spitting-seed plant grows out of the ground. It can attack one nearby enemy once before withering. It deals 1d4 damage per level on a hit.|
|**Champion Feat:** Your spitting-seed plants now deal 1d6 damage per level on a hit.|
|**Champion Feat:** Your spitting-seed plants can now attack twice before dying, although they can only attack once per round.|
|**Epic Feat:** Your spitting-seed plants now deal half damage on a miss.|

#### OPTICAL CAMO
Once per battle as a quick action, you may turn translucent, making you very hard to track. Enemies that target you with single-target attacks must reroll any attack that hits and use the second roll. This ability lasts until the next time you attack or use a power.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

</div>

### GHOST

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 DX//WS**<br>**+1 Dodge**
  
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Ghosts are partially designed for combat routines, but their primary focus is stealth and infiltration. Their genetic profile encourages speed, agility, and reflexes, and their minds are modified for patience and problem-solving.**

#### ONE STEP AHEAD
Once per battle, when an attack targeting Fortitude hits the Ghost, the attacker must reroll that attack with a -2 penalty, save ends.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. Willpower

**Hit:** Remove yourself from play. At the start of your next turn, return anywhere nearby that you could have moved to normally during your turn, and deal double damage with your first single-target attack that turn.

### MENTAT

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 IN//CH**<br>**+1 Will**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Mentats are genetically modified to increase cognitive abilities, particularly learning ability, creativity, attentiveness, and memory. Rumors exist of super-enhanced mentats with more extreme intelligences, but brain-hacking is notoriously difficult, and many attempts to redesign mental faculties result in impaired functioning, instability, or insanity.**

```
```

#### MENTAL GIANT
Once per day when you make a non-combat skill check based on Intelligence or Wisdom, he may roll twice and use either result.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat**: Once between quick rests, the Mentat can link telepathically to a nearby willing target. The Mentat can communicate telepathically through the link, regardless of the languages you know. This effect ends at a quick rest or at the end of a battle, whichever comes first.|
|**Epic Feat:** When the Mentat links minds with an ally, both the Mentat and the ally gain a +1 bonus to Willpower. This effect ends at a quick rest or at the end of a battle, whichever comes first.|
</div>

#### LIFE OF LEARNING
You gain one floating background point. You may spend one point to add an additional +1 to one skill check you make per day. The background point replenishes at the end of a long rest.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You gain one additional floating background point. You can spend your floating background points all together or one at a time.|

### Myriad

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 CN//WS**<br>**+1 Fort**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The myriad isn't a sheath in the traditional sense of the word, but rather many tiny sheaths, ranging from a couple hundred lightbulb-sized units to a few thousand pebble-sized ones. Some high-end manufacturers are said to have Myriad variants that get even smaller. The main feature of the Myriad is its ability to change shpe quickly, going from roughly human-shaped to a spreading mass of miniscule components in a matter of seconds.**

<img src='https://falconloft.github.io/SFhomebrewery/images/Swarmer.png' style='transform: scaleX(1);width:8cm; margin-top: -40px; margin-bottom: -40px;' />

```
```

#### ALL FOR ONE
Even while working to form one body, each ‘bug’ still runs it’s own defense subroutines. Enemies engaged with the Swarmer take 1d4 damage at the beginning of their turn.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per battle, an attack that would normally target Dodge can target Fortitude instead.|
|**Champion Feat:** All for One deals 1d6 damage instead of 1d4.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day, the Swarmer can explode out at all nearby enemies. As a move action, make a melee basic attack vs. each nearby enemy, dealing damage equal to twice your level.|
</div>

#### ONE FOR ALL
Once per day the swarmer can break apart into her individual components until the end of the battle (or scene), scattering tiny bugs everywhere. While in this form, the Swarmer is immune to opportunity attacks, and takes half damage from single-target attacks. 

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You may spread apart to cover the battlefield (about the size of a large room). While in this form, you can only make basic attacks, which deal half damage, and you cannot be targeted. However, you are automatically included in any attack that targets more than one creature.|
|**Epic Feat:** If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points while in your swarm form, you immediately spend a recovery (even if you don’t have any) and reform into your solid form with that many Hit Points.|

### OCTON

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 ST//DX**<br>**+1 Dodge**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Octons originally were made for uplifted octopodes, but as useful as the sheathes were, it wasn’t long until humans were transferring into them as well. They’re especially used in zero-gravity environments. They retain eight arms, although their lack of digits means that at least 2 arms are required for manipulation and at least 3 for support out of water. Octons typically crawl along in zero-gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion. Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision, providing a 360-degree field of vision, and a transgenic vocal system allows them to speak.**

#### 360 DEFENSE
You have a +2 bonus to Fortitude.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** If an enemy misses you with an opportunity attack, you deal damage to that enemy equal to its level.|
</div>

```
```

#### EIGHT-ARMED ATTACK
Once per battle, you can reroll a natural melee attack roll of 2-8. 

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Gain a +2 bonus on your reroll.|
|**Champion Feat:** Your reroll can target a different valid enemy.|
|**Epic Feat:** When you reroll an attack using Eight-Armed Attack, you can reroll up to eight dice when you roll damage. This includes dice you’ve already rerolled.|
</div>

### Skav

<p style='font-size:13.5px;'>**+1 DX//CH**<br>**+1 Dodge**

<p style='font-size:13.5px;'>**The Skav is a sheath developed from pieces taken from nearly every rodent species on Earth. The skav is approximately raccoon-sized and has a prehensile manipulator rather than a fluffy tail. They're widely regarded as being highly cute. They make excellent climbers and are gaining popularity for their usefulness in exploring because of their ability to get into tunnels and small areas. They have also been used for maintenance and tech work due to their nimbleness and manual dexterity.**

#### SKITTISH
You have a +2 Dodge bonus against opportunity attacks.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** If an enemy misses you with an attack, you may automatically pop free.|
|**Champion Feat:** You may now pop free when you miss with a melee attack.|
|**Epic Feat:** If you choose not to pop free, deal extra damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity on your next attack, hit or miss.|
</div>

#### ALL OVER THE PLACE
You are happiest moving, and that's no less true on the battlefield. When you move and is hit with an opportunity attack, the attacker is Stuck until the end of its next turn.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per day, Stun an enemy instead of making them Stuck. The attacker takes a -2 to attack until the end of its next turn.|
|**Adventurer Feat:** The enemy is Dazed instead, until the end of it’s next turn. Allies deal 1d4 extra damage to the attacker, hit or miss, until the end of your next turn.|
|**Champion Feat:** The enemy is also vulnerable to allies dealing this extra damage.|</div>

### Unsheathed

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 to ANY**<br>**+1 Will**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**As good as it is to be able to take the form you want, there's just something about natural (or mostly natural) humans that technology can't replicate. The unsheathed have gene armoring against diseases and hereditary conditions. (And probably having their looks upgraded, because why not?) Aside from that though, they're pure human.**

```
```

#### Flexibility
You start with two feats instead of one at 1st level.

#### QUICK TO FIGHT
At the start of each battle, roll initiative twice and choose the result you want.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Any allies that roll less on initiative than you do get a +2 to their result.
|**Champion Feat:** If you roll a natural 19 or 20 for initiative, increase the escalation die by 1 (usually from 0 to 1 since it’s the start of the battle).|
|**Champion Feat:** If you roll the highest initiative, you may immediately take a move action before combat starts.|
|**Epic Feat:** If you roll the highest initiative, you may also immediately take a standard action in addition to your move action. If you roll lowest, one of your allies gains a bonus to all defenses equal to your natural initative roll until the end of your first turn.|</div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Minor Deviations</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Even those who believe that resheathing isn't the best option don't always want to leave everything alone. Gills, webbed or prehensile feet, or darkvision are all possible genemods, and someone who didn't want (or couldn't afford) a new sheathe might instead opt for these. If that fits the idea for your character, just clear it with your GM first.

Minor modifications might give you an extra power, which you can take in place of your extra feat at 1st level.

## Classes

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

</div>

<div style='margin-top:-13px'></div>

### EASE OF PLAY
Even though all the classes fight at the same strength, not all classes have as many tricks or as much complexity. Here's the basics of each class.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adepts** gain a variety of limited-use powers, so there's a few options during battle, but most are not complicated.|
|**Deadeyes** rely on basic attacks, but some attacks can trigger special effects.|
|**Gatekeepers** can create wormholes that make the battlefield more complicated, and they give bonuses to allies around them.|
|**Glitches** create instances, so there's often two or more positions to track.|
|**Junkers** fight with a pet, so there's an extra creature to track. You'll also rely on combo attacks, using builders to make your finishers more powerful.|
|**Nebulas** rely on a mix of basic attacks and limited-use powers. Many powers trigger other effects.|
|**Phages** infect enemies and then deal automatic damage, but also have limited use powers that magnify their effects.|
|**Psiblades** choose from offensive and defensive powers that give mostly continuous effects, so there's few choices to make during combat.|
|**Vectors** gain a large pool of powers to work with, and can modify them during combat on the fly.|
|**Zerkers** use basic attacks which can trigger additional benefits, and also have a variety of interrupts which means they sometimes need to pay attention during others' turns.|</div>

```
```

#### HYBRID CHARACTERS
Not all character concepts fit easily into just one class. If you need to combine classes to fit your character, here's how you do it. You're halfway in between both classes, so some things change for your character.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|Choose your **Ability Score** class bonus from either class. For example, if you are a Glitch//Vector, you can gain a single +1 bonus to Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma. The specific ability that a power uses doesn’t change for hybrid characters, though. This means hybrid characters often have to be good in at least two ability scores, generally one for each class.|
|Gain the **Basic Attacks** of your choice of either class.|
|Average the **Hit Point Modifier** from both classes, rounding down when needed.|
|Average the **Recovery Dice** from both classes, rounding up when needed.|
|Use the highest **Dodge** bonus from either class for the type of armor you are wearing, but also take the largest penalty applied to that type of armor by either class.|
|Use the best **Fortitude** bonus from either of your classes.|
|Use the best **Willpower** bonus from either of your classes.|
|Gain the better **Attack Bonus** and **Damage** for each **Weapon Type** from either class, but also take the largest penalty from either class.|
|You gain **all class features from both classes**.|
|You gain **half the number of class talents or powers you'd normally get from each class**. If you need to round, round the first number down, then the second up, then the third down, etc.|
</div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Hybrid Synergy</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

If you're familiar with 13th Age, you know that you can’t apply a talent, feat, or class feature to a power or attack from a different class. Void Age doesn't use this rule by default, but if you want to use it, it's up to you.

<div style='position: absolute; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 200px; left: 64px; top: 54px'><h3>Adept</h3><br><p style='margin-top: -14px !important; font-size: 19px; text-align: center;'>**+1 ST//CH**<br>**+1 Will**</div>

<div style='position: absolute; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 488px; left: 264px; top: 49px'>
  
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The exact origins of the adept's training is lost to the ancient past, but it still makes him a formidable presence on the modern battlefield. The adept uses weapon skills that have been lost to most today. Over-reliance on automation and smart guidance systems has left most today without innate combat skills. The adept, on the other hand, has only his skill, honed through years of training.**</div>

<div class='wide'>

<div style='margin-top:120px'></div>

</div>

#### Play Style
The adept usually fights in melee, relying on a high crit range to activate his skills. many of the adept's abilities allow him to move in and out of engagement easily, letting him move about the battlefield to where he's the most needed.

#### ABILITY SCORES
An Adept's primary ability scores should usually be Strength and Chamrisma. Strength drives his melee attacks, and Charisma drives the battlefield's attention to the adept. Constitution is a close third, since the Adept will be in the middle of combat.

#### Sheaths
Adepts prefer to stay away from outside enhancements, so it's most common to find them unsheathed. Some also find the Fury or Mentat acceptable. There are even a few who consider the natural origins of the Silver or Skav an option.

#### BACKGROUNDS
Adepts are adrenaline junkies, ancient guardians, anomaly mappers, corporate troubleshooters, keepers of forgotten secrets, military instructors, royal couriers, scions of great houses, tellers of ancient legends, and wandering philosophers.

#### NETWORKS
The adept is off the radar, so to speak, for most networks. A good portion are from Earth, giving them at least passing association with WorldWeb, and many see the megacorps as leading humanity astray, so they are sometimes affiliated with FreeWeb. A few have even seen the truth of the Orisons' hope and have aligned themselves with the Commune.

#### Gear
The adept starts with one melee weapon, one ranged weapon, and one additional weapon of either type. He also starts with his choice of armor, and a few items that have a spiritual significance to him or that he has a sentimental attachment to that he's picked up in his travels.

##### ARMOR
The adept is trained is the use of all armor, but heavy armor does slow him down.

### DEADEYE

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**+1 DX//CN**<br>**+1 Dodge**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The need for hired guns never goes out of style. Whether it's in-your-face intimidation or the projected power of a marksman, a Deadeye can almost always find a home with someone who just needs things hurt.**

#### Play Style
The deadeye is simple to play. Almost every attack you make uses your basic melee or ranged attack. Depending on what you roll, you'll be able to activate manuevers that amplify your attacks. Deadeyes work equally well in melee or at range, depending on your talent choices.

#### Ability Scores
A Deadeye's primary ability score will be either Strength or Dexterity, dependant on whether they want to be in melee or stay at range. Constitution is always nice too to make sure they stay on their feet.

<img src='https://falconloft.github.io/SFhomebrewery/images/sniper.png' style='transform: scaleX(-1);width:12cm; position: absolute; bottom: 330px; left: 410px;' />

#### Sheathes
The ghost is the quintessential deadeye sniper, but when furies become deadeyes, they're great at in your face gun-fu. More recent additions like the Octon and Skav also make great deadeyes because of their special abilities.

#### Backgrounds
Deadeyes are corporate troubleshooters, asteroid belt pirates, freelance explorers, VR stuntmen, anti-corp guerrillas, blood-pit gladiators, retired snipers, burned mercenaries, eco-terrorists, and bounty hunters.

#### NETWORKS
Networks that need to operate in the dark, like the Maze, FreeWeb, or the Boardroom love Deadeyes. SecNet usually has their own forces that don't take well to what they consider to be lower-class soldiers, and the Orison hate all human fighters.

#### Gear
At 1st level, the deadeye starts with light armor, a melee weapon or two, a ranged weapon or two, and other basic gear suggested by their backgrounds.

##### Armor
The deadeye prefers light, non-metallic armor that lessens radar reflection and prefers it patterned or worn to reduce visual detection. Deadeyes prefer light armor as they need some protection, but they don't always want to be slowed down by the heavier armor.

###### Armor Bonuses
|Armor|Bonus|

|**None**|+2 Willpower|
|**Light**|+3 Fortitude|
|**Heavy**|+5 Fortitude<br>-2 Dodge|

###### Health
|Base HP|Recovery Dice|
|:---:|:---:|
|7 + CN|d8|

#### Weapons
The Deadeye's weapon of choice is a rifle to snipe, or handguns of some sort when they're pressed into melee.

The Deadeye is skilled with all ranged weapons, but need to stick to basic single-handed weapons in melee. Many of them sport custom weapons, personally hand-crafted guns that sport old military insignia or mementos from past assignments.

## GATEKEEPER

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 CN//IN**<br>**+1 Fort**
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Gatekeeper technology is an offshoot of the original wormhole progagation triggers. But the technology, like most other advances, was weaponized. The Gatekeeper relies on wormholes to make allies more mobile, and a gravwell generator to make the battlefield more hazardous for foes.**</div>

### Play Style
Gatekeepers come in two varieties: stalwart defenders that hold their place on the battlefield and serve as an anchor for theor team, and fast-moving, unpredictable banes of your enemies' existence. Sometimes they're the same gatekeeper. gatekeepers don't have a lot of moving parts, but their abilities do require some decision-making.

### ABILITY SCORES
Many Gatekeeper abilities rely positioning, so Intelligence is key. Gatekeepers also need a good Constitution, as their activites will make them a focus for some enemies.

### Sheathes
Furies provide the brawn that a gatekeeper needs to stand toe to toe with his enemies. Swarmer's are a natural fit too, as they can literally spread themselves thin to protect themselves as well as their allies. Octons are great gatekeepers as well, since they're inherently skilled at close-up defense and attack.

### BACKGROUNDS
Gatekeepers are failed bodygaurds, sergeants-at-arms, military engineers, riot-control officers, rec-hub bouncers, security guards, Galactic Church clergy, deep-space rescue coordinators, and bomb-disposal squad leaders.

### NETWORKS
Gatekeepers are often former military, as the tech they use was originally developed by SecNet. That gives them both good relationships with more militaristic networks, like SecNet and the Sunward Combine, but they're viewed with suspicion by others such as Freeweb and the Commune, both of which have good reason to distrust the military.

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

### Gear
At 1st level, gatekeepers start with a melee weapon or perhaps two, a ranged weapon if they want it, armor, a shield, and standard gear that is suggested by the specific character’s backgrounds.

#### Armor
Gatekeepers usually wear heavy armor. If you get yourself into a situation where you're in less armor — or none — your Dodge will drop.

##### Armor Bonuses
|Armor|Bonus|
|---|---|
|**None**|+2 Willpower|
|**Light**|+2 Fortitude|
|**Heavy**|+5 Fortitude|

##### Other Defenses//Health
|Base HP|Recovery Dice|
|:---:|:---:|
|8 + CN|d10|

#### WEAPONS
Gatekeepers can land damage with both one- and two-handed weapons, but since they're used to fighting with one hand on their wormhole generator, so they're not as great with two-handed weapons as far as attacking goes. Lighter ranged weapons are also better for gatekeepers.

##### Melee Weapons

## Glitch

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 DX//CH**<br>**+1 Dodge**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**There is only one glitch, and your one unique thing should account for your knowledge and mastery of your physics-shattering abilities.**
  
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The Glitch gets her name from her ability to seem to be in two places at once, allowing her to pull off feats of acrobatics, athletics, and stealth that most people couldn’t even think of. These abilities make the Glitch a force that cannot be ignored. It’s not even safe to blink.**

</div>

### Play Style
The Glitch is good at spreading herself around, picking off weaker enemies while staying away from stronger ones until she can group up on them. 

### ABILITY SCORES
Charisma is usually the Glitch's best ability since it helps you distract your enemies. Dexterity helps too, by letting you escape from the things you don't notice soon enough.

### Sheathes
Ghosts and flitters are the premiere glitches, since their intrinsic abilities complement glitch illusions so nicely. Furies fit nicely as well, and silver glitches are just scary.

### BACKGROUNDS
Glitches are Professional Acrobats, Aquisition Experts, Celebrity Impersonators, Con Artists, Elite Courtiers, Holo-Dancers, Infosec Brokers, Infiltration Specialists, Professional Gamblers, and One-Woman Gangs.

### NETWORKS
You’re probably going to be hired more by the Boardroom or the Maze; those Networks need to get things done without being traced. Most of the other Networks might occasionally hire you but with reluctance. SecNet and the Archive are the most likely to pursue you for your actions.

### Gear
At 1st level, glitches start with a few bladed weapons, light armor, and maybe a small handgun of some sort, plus various items of uncertain provenance that fit their backgrounds. 

#### Armor
Glitches work best when moving quickly. Heavier armor can supply more protection, but it makes the Glitch less effective.

###### Armor Bonuses
|Armor|Bonus|
|:---:|:---:|
|**None**|+2 Willpower|
|**Light**|+1 Fortitude|
|**Heavy**|+3 Fortitude<br>-1 Dodge|

###### Health
|Base HP|Recovery Dice|
|:---:|:---:|
|6&nbsp;+&nbsp;CN|d8|

#### WEAPONS
Like armor, glitches do best with light armament that lets them move quickly, whether it's melee or ranged.

##### Melee Weapons
||1-Handed|2-Handed|
|---|---|---|
|**Simple**|plasma knife (d8)|shockstaff (d6)|
|**Light**|toxblade (d8)|smartspear (d8)|
|**Heavy**|cryosword<br>(d8; -2 attack)|kinetic maul<br>(d10; -2 attack)|

##### Thrown Weapons
|Simple|Light|
|:---|:---|
|throwing knife, shuriken (d4)|smartspear<br>(d6; -2 attack)|

```
```

##### Ranged Weapons
||Handgun|Longarm|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Simple**|small firearms (d4)|shotgun (d6)|
|**Light**|plasma blaster (d6)|mini-launcher<br>(d6; -2 attack)|
|**Heavy**|shock rifle<br>(d8)|railgun<br>(d10; -2 attack)|

###### BASIC MELEE ATTACK
**At-Will**

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** DX + Level vs. Dodge

**Hit:** Weapon + ST (ST x2 at level 5; ST x 3 at level 8)

**Miss:** Damage equal to level

###### BASIC RANGED ATTACK
**At-Will**

**Target:** One enemy

**Attack:** IN + Level vs. Dodge

**Hit:** Weapon + IN (IN x2 at level 5; IN x 3 at level 8)

### CLASS FEATURES
The Glitch gains Blinkstep, Glitchy, and Instancing as Class Features.

#### Blinkstep
**At-Will — Move action**

**Effect:** Teleport to an enemy and make the following attack.

**Attack:** Dexterity vs. Dodge

**Hit:** Weapon Damage + Charisma
- **Natural Even Hit:** Teleport back to your original location.

#### Glitchy
You have the Glitchy background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it.

The background will assist you in any non-combat checks that your instances reasonably could.

You also gain a bonus to Initiative and Awareness checks equal to your current number of instances.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You can apply Glitchy to disengage checks, as long as at least one instance is engaged with the same enemy as you.|
|**Champion Feat:** You can automatically pop free when at least one holoclone is engaged with the same enemy as you.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per battle, when you hit with a single target attack, every instance of yourself that is also able to attack the same target may do so with a basic attack. Your instances are subject to normal combat rules if they do so (e.g. opportunity attacks).|</div>

```
```

#### Instancing
You begin with the ability to create one instance at a time, and gain the ability to create a second instance at 5th level and a third instance at 8th level.

As a move action, you can generate an Instance of yourself. This instance comes from a possible future or alternate timeline and shares your abilities and powers, but has only half the number of hit points that you do when you generate the instance. When you or your instance die, the last surviving instance of yourself is now you.

You can generate instances both in and out of combat. Having instances present can benefit you, but the GM also gets to play around with the confusion and suspicion that this causes.

Each instance of yourself gets a move and quick action, but you share one standard action between all of you.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Your instances gain extra HP equal to your level + Constitution. This increases to level + 2x CN at 5th level, and to level +3x Cn at 8th level.|
|**Champion Feat:** You can create a new instance next to you when you roll initiative.|
|**Champion Feat:** Once per battle you can attack twice per round, as long as the second attack doesn't come from the same instance as the first.|
|**Epic Feat:** You can create an instance that begins engaged with an enemy instead of next to you when you roll initiative.|</div>

### CLASS TALENTS
You gain Exploits as Class Talents.

#### Exploits
Exploits allow you to ignore the normal laws of physics that normal people have to live with. You know one exploit at 1st level, and learn more as you gain levels.

###### Bullet Time
Once per encounter, when you are the target of a ranged atatck that includes only you, you can see the attack coming. Instead of rolling defense, you choose to let it hit you or not.

If you choose to let it hit you, you can immediately make a basic attack against the attacking enemy as a free action. The attack does not provoke opportunity attacks.

If you choose to dodge the attack, the attack instead hits one random nearby enemy for half damage. If the attack includes non-damage effects, they are negated.

###### CHRONOLOCATION
**Free Action — Once per level**

**Target:** You or a nearby creature

**Attack:** Charisma vs Willpower//automatic hit on willing targets 

**Hit:** The target moves backward or forward a short distance in time. 

**Miss:** Chronolocation is not expended, but cannot be used again until the next day.

**Details:** You can use this spell to get around minor obstacles. For example, if a guard is about to walk by your not-very-good hiding place, you could jump one minute forward and arrive afer they've passed the spot.

Battles cause so much chaos that you generally cannot go back in time and redo them or avoid them by traveling to a point after they happened, but you can redo skill checks or role-playing encounters. You also can't simply jump forward in time until after a major objective is complete, since you're not present during the period you're skipping to effect such a change. 

However, you can see if your GM is willing to offer you a deal. Perhaps you **can** leap forward in time to avoid that big boss fght, or otherwise make major changes to the course of events — but the universe will fnd a way to make you pay for it. The cost could be a campaign loss, or a change in your relationship with one icon from positive or complicated to negative. Maybe your meddling transports you and your allies to a diferent, darker timeline. You’ll just have to figure out how badly you want that victory....

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You can bring your allies or 1d4+1 enemies with you through time.|</div>

```
```

###### Corrupted Dataset
**Once per battle — Quick action**

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. the lower of Fortitude or Willpower

|**Willpower:** The Glitch gains a +2 bonus to saves.|</div>

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|**Champion Feat:** An easy save is now needed to continue Corrupted Dataset's effect.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day, the enemy takes a -2 penalty to all defenses, and the Glitch gains both the Fortitude and Willpower benefits.|</div>

###### Daredevil
**Daily — Quick action**

**Effect:** If you have at least one holoclone, you can pull off a stunt the likes of which others could scarcely conceive. This is an improvisational talent. 

You do not need a skill check to pull the stunt off. However, if you attack as part of the stunt, you do need to roll normally for the attack.

If your holoclones help with the stunt, they end up wherever it makes sense for them to be when the stunt is done.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You can use Daredevil twice a day.|</div>

###### Double Vision
**Ranged — Daily**

**Target:** One nearby enemy with less than 50 HP per level or two enemies with less than 25 HP each.

**Attack:** CH vs. Willpower

**Hit:** The target is confused (save continues).

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** If you miss all targets, you regain this power during your next quick rest.|
|**Champion Feat:** Each successful save to continue the power deals 1d4 psychic damage per level to the target.|
|**Epic Feat:** The save to continue Double Vision is now easy.|</div>

You must end your move on a surface that can support you normally. You cannot move across air in this way, nor can you walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor do you need to make checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

###### Reality Shards
**Daily**

**Effect:** You create 1d4+1 instance shards with 1 HP each that are identical to you near your current location. You and any normal instances vanish from the battlefield. Each shard can move and attack using one of your basic attacks. On the beginning of your next turn, or when there is only one shard left in the battle, return yourself to the battle by replacing one of the remaining shards with yourself. All shards vanish. Any previous instances do not return.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

If you like the rsults of your turn, it becomes permanent, and any changes made to any creatures during your turn likewise become permanent.

If you decide to rewind your turn, all changes that occurred during your turn are erased. You do not get another full turn. Instead, you get one standard action, so you can prepare for what you just saw happen. If you are killed or knocked unconscious during the turn that you use rewind, before you've decided to make it permanent or not, time automatically reverses back to the beginning of your turn.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Junkers make their homes in the wastes of Earth, or in the abandoned areas of ancient orbitals or colonies. They’ve learned to live off of what others leave behind. They travel with animal companions — or mechanical ones they’ve made for themselves out of the remnants of the past.**</div>

### Overview

#### Play Style
The junker can hold his own in combat, but he’s much more powerful alongside (or sometimes behind) his companion. His attacks build combo points which he can use to activate powerful finishers.

#### ABILITY SCORES

#### Sheathes

#### BACKGROUNDS
Junkers are antique collectors, arcology scavengers, consulting archeologists, deep ruin divers, dropship scroungers, earthbound nomads, exotic animal tamers, itinerant troubleshooters, and professional stowaways.

### Gear
At 1st level, junkers start with a ranged weapon and a couple melee weapons and some ragged light armor, probably camouflaged. They also usually have a few items for sheltering from the weather, and either tools or medical supplies to care for their companion.

### Class Features
You gain Companion, Hardy, Scavenger, and Terrain Stunt as Class Features.

#### Companion
You have a devoted normal-sized animal or mechanical companion who fights alongside you like a member of your team.

##### Companion Bonuses
Choose the bonus that fits your companion the best. Your companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the type.

###### Charge
**Your companion acts before you.**

It gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its attack during the same turn.

###### Flight
**Your companion acts before you.**

It flies! Its melee damage die is dropped by one size (d10 drops to d8; d8 to d6; d6 to d4).

###### Pack Mentality
**Your companion acts after you.**

It gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies you attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with you.

###### Toxic
**Your companion acts after you.**

It also deals ongoing poison damage equal to twice your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

###### Ruthless
**Your companion acts before you.**

Its crit range expands by 2 against enemies with lower initiative.

###### Threatening
**Your companion acts before you.**

Enemies engaged with your companion take a -2 penalty to attack if they do not include your companion in the attack.

###### Tough
**Your companion acts after you.**

It gains temporary hit points equal to its level each time it hits with an attack.

```
```

##### Baseline Stats
Use the following stats for your animal companion. Your companion is always your level. Your companion attacks vs AC. Your companion’s Fortitude is usually higher than its Willpower, but you can flip that if it makes sense.

###### Baseline Stats
|Lvl|Atk|Dmg|Dodge|Fort|Will|HP|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**1**|+5|1d8|+5|+4|+0|20|
|**2**|+6|1d10|+6|+5|+1|27|
|**3**|+7|2d6|+7|+6|+2|36|
|**4**|+9|3d6|+8|+7|+3|45|
|**5**|+10|4d6|+10|+9|+5|54|
|**6**|+11|5d6|+11|+10|+6|72|
|**7**|+13|6d6|+12|+11|+7|90|
|**8**|+14|7d6|+14|+13|+9|108|
|**9**|+15|8d6|+15|+14|+10|144|
|**10**|+17|9d6|+16|+15|+11|180|

##### Calling to Battle
When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal companion during the battle with a quick action.

##### Actions
Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

##### Damage//Dying
Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points. If your companion dies, it’s gone for the battle, though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle. That companion will be one level lower you. At the start of the battle after that, bump the companion up to your level.

##### Companion Feats
Companion feats don't build on each other like other feats, so you don’t have to animal companion feats progressively (Adventurer first, then Champion, then Epic). You just need to have access to listed tier.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per day, your companion can attack twice in a round with a standard action.|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per battle, your companion can turn a disengage success by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per day, reroll one of your companion’s missed attack rolls.|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Your companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.|
|**Champion Feat:** Once per day, your companion can force an enemy to reroll an attack that hit it.|
|**Champion Feat:** Your companion’s Fortitude increases by +1.|
|**Epic Feat:** Increase your companion’s damage die by one size (for example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).|
|**Epic Feat:** Your companion’s Dodge and Willpower increase by +1.|</div>

#### Hardy
You gain two additional recoveries. You also never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat, or exposure. You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking, but only a couple days longer.

#### Scavenger
You have the Scavenger background at its full possible bonus of +5, without having to spend your normal background points on it. You are an expert in abandoned civilizations, capable of reading clues from ruins that others can’t perceive. However, being a wilder doesn’t really help in either untouched natural environments or heavily traveled urban environments.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** Scavenger now works as well in densely packed urban environments or slums as it does in ruins.|
|**Epic Feat:** Your heightened pattern matching abilities let you predict with great accuracy where flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn’t be trackable have gone, and there’s the possibility that even teleports give you a sense of direction.|</div>

```
```

#### Terrain stunt
At the start of each battle in an abandoned or disused environment, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you’ll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt. Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.

Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the detritus that humans leave behind. Upending a rusting vat of acid onto an enemy's head, shooting the brace of an unstable catwalk, and using a junkpile to get that little bit of altitude you need to attack the out-of-reach enemy behind an energy shield are all examples of Terrain Stunts.

### Class Talents
You gain Calls as class talents. Some are Builders that grant Synergy Points, and others are Finishers that spend Synergy Points. You know three basic Calls at 1st level, and learn more, as well as being able to improve some, as you gain more levels.

#### Calls
Calls are at-will powers that let either you or your companion pull off special attacks. Every call requires a standard action. Depending on who uses the call, the effects are different.

###### Who Uses the Call?
|You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Your Companion|
|:---|:---|
|Use your attack modifier.|Use your companion's attack modifier.|
|Use the call's damage.|Use the call's damage.|
|You gain any positive effects.|Your companion gains any positive effects.|

At first level, you begin with 3 basic calls. All the calls listed below are shown in their basic form. You'll also see **Upgrade** and **Ultimate** lines as part of the calls. As you level up, you'll learn more basic calls, but you'll also gain Upgraded calls, and finally the Ultimate version of some of your calls. The **Upgrade** and **Ultimate** lines tell you how to modify the calls when you gain those versions.

## Nebula

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 IN//DX**<br>**+1 Will**
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**The Nebula has trained extensively in the use of nanites, although this makes her a pariah in some communities. Nanites are capable of boosting allies, but also disrupting and harming enemies.**</div>

### Play Style
The Nebula is designed to be very much a team player. The majority of the Nebula’s routines either hinder the enemy or help their allies, with only a few left over to do direct damage. The brand of nanite you choose will affect the playstyle as well, granting secondary abilities to you or your allies.

### ABILITY SCORES
The Nebula needs Intelligence to use their routines, but they aren’t well-protected, so they need Dexterity as well to stay alive.

### Sheathes
Swarmers are a natural fit for the nebula, since they can flow around enemies nearly as easily as their nanites. Skavs are a common choice as well, since they can get away from enemies more easily. 

### BACKGROUNDS
Nebulas are black-market surgeons, brain hackers, eco-freak sympathizers, experimental medical technicians, high-sec infiltrators, illegal chemical smugglers, platinum-label brewmasters, street magicians, and techno-organic system coders.

### NETWORKS
There's not a network that doesn't need the support the nebula can give, but that doesn't mean they're all friendly to the idea either. The Maze and Freeweb like the invisibility of it, but SecNet and the Archive have severe restrictions placed on nanite use, and some in the Commune will shoot you as soon as look at you if they suspect nanite use. Something about them really bothers the Orison.

### Gear
At 1st level, nebulas usually have a small blade of some sort, and maybe a handgun. They also usually have a few small items on them as momentos from whoever employed them last, as well as a specialized interface device that lets them reprogram their nanites on the fly.

#### Armor
Nebulas are comfortable in any type of armour, but they generally don’t use shields as they need a free hand to make tweaks to their nanite swarm.

##### Armor Bonuses

|**Light**|+1 Fortitude|
|**Heavy**|+3 Fortitude|

##### Other Defenses//Health

|:---:|:---:|
|7&nbsp;+&nbsp;CN|d6|

#### WEAPONS
Nebulas are comfortable with any light blades, and ranged weapons that don’t take a lot of technique to fire
straight. They usually stay away from the large stuff as they need to be very mobile.

## PSIBLADE

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 ST//WS**<br>**+1 Fort**
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Some who manifest psionic ability use it more through brute force than through finesse. Psiblades are trained in how to harness their powers, they throw it around through sheer force of will. They're often recognized when they endure mortal wounds through raw will, but what most recognise first are the glowing shards of energy that they create and use as weapons.**</div>

### Play Style
?????

### ABILITY SCORES
Strength is the most important score for a Psiblade as it determines melee rolls and damage. Wisdom is also needed, as the Psiblade's mental attacks key off of it. Depending on whether you want to stay in melee or fight from a distance, Constitution or Dexterity score is also important.

### Sheathes
?????

### BACKGROUNDS
Psiblades are xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx, and xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx.

### NETWORKS
Some networks look up on those with psionic power as interesting and different, but some view psions with suspicion, not trusting what they cannot measure directly. Regardless of any disparaging viewpoints, most Networks agree that Psiblades are very useful, not only because of the fear they inspire in some, but also because they have fewer needs in the way of outfitting.

### Gear
The Psiblade begins play with a set of light armor along with a couple weapons, whatever compliments their favorite form of blade or has utility, like an axe for breaking through a door. They usually have a few well-worn (some might say abused) items to help them focus their powers, and they almost always have some way of hiding their identity, since there's still more than a few people scared of psions. 

#### ARMOR
Psiblades typically wear lighter armors. Heavier armor is cumbersome and heavy for the sort of acrobatic defense most Psiblades prefer, but worse still is the way such armors weigh on the minds of the psiblade.

##### Armor Bonuses
|Armor Type|Bonus|
|:---:|:---:|
|**None**|+2 Willpower|

|**Heavy**|+4 Fortitude<br>-2 Dodge|

Psiblades have found ways to unnaturally boost their speed through raw arcane power coursing through their veins, trading powerful strikes at their foes for increasing the number of attacks they make. Your weapon damage die drops one notch. If your first attack is a natural even roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action.

If you decide you don't want to try for a double blade attack, declare it before rolling your attack; the single attack will deal the normal damage dice instead of using reduced damage dice. This talent is only usable when using your psiblade.

## VECTOR

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 IN//CH**<br>**+1 Will**
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Through willpower and sheer intellect, the Vector tears reality (and others' perception of it) and bends it to his will, helping his allies and harming his foes. Vectors use pure psionic power, eschewing physical weapons almost entirely.**</div>

### Play Style
The Vector tends to stand back from the middle of the fight, instead choosing to control the battlefield itself or assist allies as they fight.

### ABILITY SCORES
A Vector's ability to fight are directly dependent on his imagination and his will to alter his surroundings, so Charisma is the key score, followed by Intelligence. Dexterity and Constitution are also important since these help him to stay alive long enough to finish the fight.

### Sheathes
Mentats sometimes seem to be made specifically made for Vectors, although the predate them by centuries. Flitters and Myriads are also popular choices, as their smaller size makes them harder to destroy.

### BACKGROUNDS
Vectors are arbitration agents, con artists, eloquent diplomats, itenerant musicians, master seducers, megacorp lawyers, ordained Galactic Church ministers, professional stress testers, public relations hacks, and xenolinguists.

### NETWORKS
Your relationship with the Networks really depend on how the Networks view people that seek to categorise and delineate things. Juzhen is probably never going to like you. SecNet is uneasy with power they can’t control. The Commune, The Maze, and FreeWeb are probably more easy around your abilities.

### Gear
The Vector usually starts off with one or two weapons, a set of light armor, and a few antique books, mostly things like *The 3rd Annual Guide to Terran Offshoots* and *How to Make the Most of Your Physics Mistakes*. These are almost always hardcopy.

#### Armor
Vectors don’t usually wear armour. It doesn’t exactly hurt them or stop them from initiating their commands, but it does throw their aim off.

### CLASS FEATURES
The Vector learns Commands and unlocks Cores as he levels. You begin knowing two Commands, and learn more as you level.

Each Command has seven versions, and these become avilable to the Vector by unlocking Cores. You begin with 2 Cores unlocked, and unlock more as you level.

The Vector also uses Zones that determine the targets for his Commands. The two Zones are Origin and Ray. These are modifiable with feats.

#### Commands
| |
|---|
|**Bolster** helps allies.|
|**Detect** lets you find creatures or objects.|
|**Form** lets you create and control objects.|
|**Inflict** damages enemies.|
|**Protect** lets you protect yourself and allies from damage or creatures.|
|**Summon** lets you pull creatures into battle alongside your allies.|

#### Cores
The Core is what is being acted on or affected by the Vector’s Command. The seven Cores are:

<div class='air'>###### Air
Make allies fly, create wind or vacuum, and deal sonic damage. Detect pockets of air or vacuum, protect your allies from Orison, and summon Orison to help you fight.</div>

<div class='body'>###### Body
Boost allies' damage and physical skills, manipulate gravity, and deal gravitic damage. Detect and protect your allies from animals, and summon animals to help you fight.</div>

```
```

#### Zones
Commands determine targets by Zone, which dictates who and what the Command affects. 

##### BASIC ZONES
You learn Origin and Ray at 1st level. You can learn advanced Zones by taking feats.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|

**Target:** One nearby or far away enemy.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

##### ADVANCED ZONES

Advanced Zones are learned through feats.

###### Chain
**Daily**

**Target:** One nearby or faraway enemy.

**Natural Even Hit:** You may make the same attack against the next valid target for the Command that's nearest to the original target. If it hits, the target takes half damage or gains half the benefit (or full if half isn't possible) and you make another attack with the same qualifications. This continues as long as your rolls have natural even results or you run out of nearby targets.

###### Explosive
**Once per battle**

**Target:** 1d4+1 nearby or far away enemies.

###### Touch
**Target:** All engaged enemies. 

**Special:** You don't provoke opportunity attacks.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** Touch gains Recharge 16+.|
|**Epic Feat:** Touch now has Recharge +12.|</div>

### CLASS TALENTS
You gain Syntaxes as Class Talents. You learn three Syntaxes at 1st level. At the beginning of each combat, you gain the benefit of one of your known Syntaxes.

#### Syntaxes
<div style='margin-top:-10px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per day, you may switch your Syntax during combat, at the beginning of your turn.|
|**Champion Feat:** You may switch your Syntax as much as you like, but each time after the first requires a successful normal save. A failed save means you can't switch Syntaxes again that battle.|
|**Epic Feat:** The save needed to change Syntaxes is now an easy save.|</div>

###### Accuracy
You gain a +2 bonus to attacks using Commands.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** When the Escalation Die is 3+, if you miss your target, make a second attack against the nearest enemy to your first target.|</div>

```
```

###### Flexibility
Once per battle, you may cause a Command to target Fortitude instead of Dodge or Willpower.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Once per day, if an attack hits any of the target’s defenses, it succeeds.|</div>

###### Power
Saves to end the effects of your Commands take a -2 penalty.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** When an enemy ends the effect of one of your Commands, he takes damage equal to your level. This increases to 2x your level at 5th level, and to 3x your level at 8th level.|</div>

###### Preperation
Once per battle, you may finish a Command but not activate it, instead adding a trigger to the Command. The trigger can be one simple Command, such as 'when someone steps on it', or 'in three rounds'. When the triggering conditions are met, the Command activates.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Preparation gains Recharge 16+.|
|**Champion Feat:** If a Prepared Command is not activated by the end of the battle, you may use one free recovery.|</div>

###### Stalwart
When an attack deals damage to you, as an interrupt, the Vector may expend a recharge, once per battle, or daily shape to gain Resistance 8 vs. that power.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You don't use up your one Interrupt per round when you use Stalwart.|
|**Champion Feat:** Stalwart's Resistance improves to 6.|
|**Epic Feat:** When you use Stalwart, you may also make an immediate attack against that enemy.|</div>

###### Subtlety
When you use a Command, you can try to hide its source. Make an attack of IN + level vs. the Willpower of the target. If successful, the target of the Command does not know that you were its origin.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** On a 16+ on the Subtlety check, the target thinks it came from a nearby creature of your choice.|</div>

###### Surprise
Once per battle as a quick action, you can use one or more Factors you know to create a startling environmental effect, somehow changing the battlefield, or pulling off a stunt that others can scarcely understand. You may make an attack (anything causing damage counts as an attack) as part of the stunt, but you'll need to roll normally for the attack. This is an improvisational talent.

###### Vagueness
Your Inflict Commands deal damage equal to you level on a miss.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** Add your Intelligence to Inflict's miss damage.|</div>

### Command List
Each Command has seven versions. You can use the versions that match the Cores you've unlocked.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You learn the Parallel Threads ability below.|</div>

###### Parallel Threads
**Daily**

**Standard Action + Quick Action**

**Effect:** you can use two Commands at the same time. Declare this before you begin rolling. Roll as many times as needed for the first Command, then apply those rolls to the other Command in the same order, making additional rolls if needed. 

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You can use Parallel Threads twice per day.|
|**Epic Feat:** You can use Parallel Threads once per battle.|</div>

```
```

#### Bolster
The Vector may bend reality to give their allies the advantage. Each version of Bolster requires the **Core** listed. 
<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You gain a +1 bonus to sustain Bolster effects. This increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th.|
|**Champion Feat:** Once per battle, when you bolster an ally, the ally can heal instead of gaining a bonus. You spend the recovery and roll the heal using your Recovery Dice.|
|**Epic Feat:** If you heal an ally with Bolster, whoever has the better recovery dice rolls the Recovery.|</div>

<div class='air'>###### Bolster Air

<div class='metal'>###### Bolster Metal

**Check:** CH vs 12 + level

**Success:** Ally is considered to be wearing heavy armor without any accomanying class penalties and until the end of the battle or scene.

#### Form
**Daily (Recharge 16+)**

The Vector can create and manipulate temporary simple objects. Objects last until the end of the encounter or scene, or until destroyed, whichever happens first. Often, this will create difficulty for enemies of an advantage for allies. If a difficulty is created, usually a normal save will overcome it. When one enemy overcomes it, all of them do. If an advantage is created, an ally may use it as a quick action, to pull off a stunt. They may make an attack (anything causing damage counts as an attack) as part of the stunt, but need to roll normally for the attack.

<div class='air'>###### Form Air
**Check:** CH vs. 12 + level

**Success:** The Vector can use wind or vacuum to create a difficulty for one enemy or advantage for one ally.

**Failure:** As Success, but the Vector is Vulnerable, save ends.</div>

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain a free use of Form per day, if you don't already have one. You can use Form [Air] to create a tornado. The tornado attacks any nearby enemies and and any enemy that begins its turn near it using the Vector's CH vs Fortitude. It deals 1d6 damage per level to any enemies it hits. It must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Sonic ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain a free use of Form per day, if you don't already have one. You can use Form [Body] to create a gravity vortex that pulls in nearby enemies. The vortex negates 1d4+1 move actions (2d4+2 at 5th level, 3d4+3 at 8th level). Since it negates move actions and not movement for a number of rounds, the more move actions a creature spends, the sooner it breaks free. A vortex only negates a creature's own movements, however, so someone else not in the vortex may still pull it free. A vortex lasts until it has negated all its move actions, and any enemy that ends its turn near it while it still has move actions to negate will be pulled in. It must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Gravitic ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

<div class='fire'>###### Form Fire
**Check:** CH vs. 12 + level

**Success:** The Vector can use any fire already present to create a difficulty for one enemy or advantage for one ally.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain a free use of Form per day, if you don't already have one. You can use Form [Fire] to create a fire barrier. The barrier runs in a straight line and deals 1d6 thermic damage per level to 1d4+1 creatues that pass through it and then dissapates. Any attacks that pass through the barrier take a -2 penalty. If no one moves through the barrier on any round, the number of creatures it should damage is lowered by one if anyone has attacked through the barrier. One end of the barrier must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Thermic ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

<div class='light'>###### Form Light
**Check:** CH vs. 12 + level

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain a free use of Form per day, if you don't already have one. You can use Form [Light] to create an illusory wall. The wall runs in a straight line and blocks all line of sight, but attacks can still pass through it. If someone tries to attack through the wall, they must succeed at a hard save or miss entirely. As soon as someone passes through the wall, the save reduces to a Normal save. A second ndividual moving through the wall reduces the save to an Easy one, and a third creature that moves through causes the wall to vanish. One end of the wall must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Shock ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Champion Feat:** You gain a free use of Form per day, if you don't already have one. You can use Form [Metal] to create a wall formed from available metal (even if there doesn't seem to be any). The wall runs in a straight line and blocks 15 damage per level before it falls apart. When the wall falls, it deals 1d8 damage per level to every enemy standing near it. One end of the wall must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Acid ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

The barrier runs in a straight line and deals 1d6 psionic damage per level to 1d4+1 creatues that pass through it and then dissapates. Any enemy attacks that target Willpower cannot target creatures on the other side of the barrier, but ally attacks that target Willpower gain a bonus equal to your Charisma if they pass through the barrier. One end of the barrier must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|

|**Champion Feat:** Once per day, you may use Form [Water] to create an ice wall. The wall runs in a straight line and causes 1d4 attacks that go through the wall to deal half damage before it breaks. Any non-damage effects from those attacks are negated. When the wall breaks it attacks every enemy CH vs. Fortitude, and every enemy it hits takes 1d4 damage per level. One end of the wall must be placed adjacent to you unless the Zone used is Ray.|
|**Epic Feat:** Once per day (Recharge 6+) when you roll initiative you may create Cryonic ammunition for you or one nearby ally to use. See Elemental Ammo on page 02 of the Armory for details.|</div>

## zerker

</div>

<div class='wide' style='padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px;column-width:150px;display: table;'>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:19px; display: table-cell; width: 150px; vertical-align: middle;'>**+1 ST//DX**<br>**+1 Fort**
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Zerkers excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. By surging completely unsafe levels of power through their cybernetics, they rip through the battlefield, causing enemies to flee from before them.**</div>

### Play Style
The zerker is the epitome of aggression. Zerkers are at their best when they're surrounded by enemies so they can activate their defensive protocols more often, and so they have their choice of targets for their offensive protocols.

### ABILITY SCORES
Although some Zerkers compliment their melee skills with ranged attacks, a zerker is always at his best when he’s in someone’s face. A good Strength score makes sure he’s a threat. A good Constitution score lets them keep up the pressure longer.

### Sheathes
The Fury is the best match for a Zerker. Some like Skavs to boost their movement, and Ghosts are a popular option too, just so they can get the drop on their enemies.

### BACKGROUNDS
Zerkers are agression therapists, DIY enthusiasts, enthusiastic machinophiles, former crimelords, hyberbike gangers, longshot pilots, obsessed thrill-seekers, organic hackers, recovering zoners, and washed-out mercenaries.

### NETWORKS
There’s really only one thing that Networks hire Zerkers for — threat. Whether it’s the Archive making sure that one of the mega-corps doesn’t harass its compilers or the Maze wanting to intimidate a politician, their first stop is usually a Zerker.

<div class='footpgy'></div>

<div class='footpgtxty'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

### Gear
The zerker starts with a couple one-handed melee weapons or one two-handed melee weapon, plus a ranged weapon, probably thrown. Zerkers by default don't wear armor as it hinders their reactions. That's not a problem since their cybernetic modifications usually more than make up for it. They do like to keep trophies or mementos of previous fights though, and usually carry a few of these around with them.

#### Armor
A Zerker relies on his protocols to keep him safe. Armor supplements Fortitude, but it gets in the way of Dodge.

##### Armor Bonuses
|Armor|Bonus|
|:---:|:---:|
|**None**|+4 Willpower|
|**Light**|+3 Fortitude|
|**Heavy**|+4 Fortitude|

##### Health
|Base HP|Recovery Dice|
|:---:|:---:|
|8&nbsp;+&nbsp;CN|d10|

#### WEAPONS
The zerker is most at home with the most threatening weapons he can find. Bigger is always better as far as he's concerned. When it comes to ranged weapons, he can use thrown weapons better than firearms.

##### Melee Weapons
||1-Handed|2-Handed|
|---|---|---|
|**Simple**|plasma knife (d4)|shockstaff (d6)|
|**Light**|toxblade (d6)|smartspear (d8)|
|**Heavy**|cryosword (d8)|kinetic maul (d10)|

##### Thrown Weapons
|Simple|Light|
|:---|:---|
|throwing knife, shuriken (d8)|smartspear (d10)|

|**Heavy**|shock rifle<br>(d8; -4 attack)|railgun<br>(d8; -2 attack)|

### CLASS FEATURES
You gain Artificial Soul and Frenzied as Class Features.

#### Artificial Soul
Zerkers bind themselves to metal and technology, and computer algorithms take over in place of training and experience. Some say they lose something of themselves in the process. You don't die until you fail five death saves, but you must subtract your Charisma score from all attacks if it is positive.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** If your Charisma score is negative, add +1 to your melee attacks and Fortitude.|
|**Champion Feat:** You don’t die from damage until your negative hit points equal your maximum hit points, instead of half your maximum.|
|**Epic Feat:** One battle per day, you can choose to succeed with death saves on an 11+ instead of a 16+.|</div>

#### Frenzied
You are always considered to be fighting with two weapons. In other words, if your attack roll is a natural 2, you can reroll the attack but must use the reroll. You cannot use a Protocol with this reroll.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Adventurer Feat:** You can reroll results of 2-4 with Frenzied.|
|**Champion Feat:** If you miss with a Frenzied reroll, heal equal to your Constitution. This increases to 2x CN at 5th level, and to 3x Cn at 8th level.|
|**Epic Feat:** When you hit with a Frenzied reroll, deal half damage to any engaged enemies not included in the original attack.|</div>

```
```

### CLASS TALENTS
You gain Protocols as Class Talents.

#### PROTOCOLS
The Zerker learns three protocols at first level, and learns more at higher levels. Protocols are mental and physical augments that allow him to operate in ways that normal people cannot. Each protocol grants specific benefits based on the natural attack roll of either the Zerker or an enemy targeting the Zerker. Attack and damage bonuses from separate protocols do not stack. Use the highest bonus only.

Each Protocol has a three types of effects, Passive, Triggered, and Overload.

##### PASSIVE PROTOCOLS
These are 'always on' abilities that requires no action or roll. Some are limited in use to either a single battle per day, or once per battle.

##### TRIGGERED PROTOCOLS
Triggered Protocols are activated, or triggered, by specific types of rolls.

###### Offensive 
Offensive protocols are triggered when you attack. You may use one per attack. Choose which to use after you see the result of your attack roll.

###### Defensive
Defensive protocols are triggered when you roll Defense. interrupts. Choose to use one of these when you roll for defense.

###### Initiative
Initiative protocols don't use an action. These trigger when you roll Initiative or Awareness.

The Zerker may Overload a protocol as a free action to receive a large immediate bonus. If the Zerker does so, he can gain no further bonuses from that protocol until the next encounter. Each protocol may be overloaded only one time each day.

## The Armory

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Here is where you'll find the equipment your character needs in order to survive. From the common stim packs and energy shields to the as-yet unexplained motes.**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**There are two basic types of equipment. Prototype items are permanent items used as loot during adventures and rewards for success. Consumables are one-use items that need to be purchased or found.**

</div>

### Consumables

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Consumables are items that you can use once. When you use them, remove them from your inventory. The common types of consumable items include stims, ammo packs, and motes.**

#### Ammo Packs
Ammo packs provide enhancement to weapons that lasts until the end of a battle or for five minutes before fading.

Bonuses from ammo packs don’t stack with prototype weapons' inherent bonuses. Use the higher bonus.

It’s a quick action to insert an ammo pack into your weapon.

##### Auto-targeting
This ammunition has been programmed to be especially useful against one of the following threat types: Aberration, Animal, Construct, Humanoid, Orison, Zoned.

Once per battle, an attack against the designated threat type using this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses. (Recharge 6+)

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|
|Normal -1|Normal|Normal +1|</div>

##### Elemental
Elemental ammo doesn’t give a bonus to attacks or damage, but causes the weapon to deal a particular type of energy damage. For the types of resistance available, see Damage Types on page XX. 

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|:---:|
|**Adventurer//Champion//Epic**|

##### Explosive
When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, the target also pops free from each enemy
engaged with it.

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|

##### Fragmented
On a miss, you can make a basic ranged attack against another foe that is near the target or along your line of sight to the target (between you and the original target or past the original target).

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Adventurer//Champion//Epic**|
|Normal +1|</div>

##### Hardlight Decoy
The ammo generates several decoy shots that look identical to the real one that's just been fired, possibly fooling your target into dodging in the wrong direction. When you attack with this ammunition, use the target’s lowest defense instead of the defense your attack would normally target.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it’s also vulnerable to all attacks until the start of your next turn.

| |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|
|Normal -1|Normal|Normal +1|</div>

##### Twin
When you attack with twin ammunition, a second projectile is fired a split second after the first and targets the same or a different enemy. Make a free action basic ranged attack for it with a +8 attack bonus instead of your normal bonus (champion: +12; epic: +16).

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

##### Webline
When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it loses the flight ability (save ends). If the target is presently flying, it must attempt to land during its next turn.

```
```

#### Stims
You can buy stims that match the tier of your current environment. You can carry as many stims as you wish. Using a stim takes a standard action, even if you don’t have it ready. Using a stim on an unconscious ally is also a standard action.

You can only be under the effect of a single stim at a time. If you’re using a stim that has an ongoing effect, using another stim ends the first effect. Stim effects last until the end of a battle, or around five minutes if you’re prepping for a battle and using stims beforehand.

##### Adrenaline
A use of this stim removes fatigue, hunger and thirst. It’s as if you’d slept solidly for eight hours and had a square meal afterwards. It does not refresh limited-use powers.

Each adrenaline stim restores one recovery. (champion: 2 recoveries; epic: 3 recoveries)

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|
|Normal|Normal +2|Hard|</div>

##### Fortification
You may immediately make a save against an ongoing save ends effect caused by a foe or hazard of the same tier or lower as the stim.

For the rest of the battle, you gain a +1 bonus to saves against effects caused by foes and hazards of the same tier or lower as the stim. Saves against higher-tier threats aren’t affected by the stim.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|
|Normal +1|Normal +2|Hard|</div>

##### Medical
A medstim lets the creature using it heal using one of their recoveries. Stims provide bonus healing on top of what you’d generally get with a recovery, but there’s a hit point cap for the maximum healing you can get from a stim, no matter how well you roll your recovery.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Tier**|**Cost**|**Bonus&nbsp;Heal**|**HP&nbsp;Cap**|

##### Regen
Regen stims give almost the same healing effect as a healing stim, but spread it out over time. When you use a regen stim, you spend a recovery, and that recovery’s healing effect gets spread out over several rounds.

With an adventurer-tier regen stim, you regain one die worth of hit points at the end of each turn until that recovery’s exhausted. If you’ve got a Constitution bonus, then that applies to each recovrey die you roll. Champion-tier stims restore two dice worth of hit points per turn; epic stims do three dice of healing.

The regeneration effect ends when you’re reduced to 0 hit points.

#### Energy Spikes
Energy spikes augment defenses. You can only be under the effect of one energy spike at a time. Energy spikes partially deflect ranged attacks in a small area around you, but you must stay near the Energy Spike to receive the bonuses.

Bonuses from energy fields don't stack with prototype armor bonuses. Use the higher bonus.

It's a quick action to activate an energy spike.

##### ablative
Ablative spikes confer an Dodge bonus of +1 (adventurer), +2 (champion), or +3 (epic).

|**Adventurer**|**Champion**|**Epic**|

##### Resistance
When you use a resistance spike, you gain Resistance to a single specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier or lower. Resistance from an field is always 16+. Damage from a source that’s a higher tier than your spike ignores your resistance. (See Resistance on page XX.) For the types of resistance available, see Damage Types on page XX.

#### Motes
Motes began drifting through the solar system shortly after the Orison arrived. whether it's coincidence or not has yet to be determined, but the Orison do not seem to make use of them. Motes appear to be beneficial, but the exact effect appears to be random.

Motes give a weapon a +1 attack bonus, and give armor a +1 Dodge bonus.

Each mote also provides a random enhancement to the item it is applied to. Roll for the effect when the mote is applied to the item. An item can have only one mote applied to it at a time. Motes do not stack with other items; use the highest bonus.

### Prototypes

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Prototypes are one-of-a-kind items. You can find them during an adventure or receive them as gifts and rewards from NPCs, but you’ll seldom find anyone willing to sell one.**

#### Quirks
Prototypes are inhabited by AI that communicate with you in order to grant you effects that you normally couldn't pull off by yourself. That's great, but there's a downside too. They've all got their own personalities, so for every prototype you atune yourself to, you have a little voice in your head oncouraging you to do things that it wants to do, or you sense bursts of emotion from it when you do something 'wrong'.

Each prototype has a personality that is largely defined by its quirk. What you can count on as a default is that nearly all prototypes want to be used and used well.

#### Prototype Limits
Some prototypes are available at any level, with greater bonuses or other effects for champion and epic-tier versions. Others can be found only at champion or epic levels.

You can handle a number of prototypes equal to your level. Items one tier above you count as two items, and epic items count as three items if you are an adventurer tier character.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>| |
|---|
|If you equip a number of prototypes that is equal to or lower than your current level, the personality quirks will tug at you, giving you sudden urges and desires that will feel natural to give in to. But you’ll be in charge.|
|If you equip a number of prototypes that is greater than your current level, the personality quirks are going to have more power over you. You’re no longer running the show; instead, the prototypes are, to some extent, running you. Herein lies a roleplaying challenge for the player and the GM.|</div>

#### One Size Fits
It's safe to assume that anyone who finds a prototype can use it. Don't worry about size.

#### Default Bonuses
Default Bonuses are usually passive abilities, either always on, or on under certain cirumstances. You don't have to worry about doing anything special to get the benefits.

```
```

#### Prototype Powers
Unless otherwise specified, prototype powers with a recharge chance have to be activated and require a free action to use. They will also have a trigger condition that you must meet to use the prototype.

Prototype powers that do not specify a recharge chance or a specific usage pattern have powers that are always available.

Some prototype powers list a recharge number (6+, 11+, or 16+). You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which you’ve used a prototype’s power, roll a d20. If your roll equals or exceeds the recharge number for that item, you can use that prototype power again that day. If the roll fails, the prototype power is expended until you take a full heal-up.

#### Prototype List
Some prototypes — armor, weapons, energy shields — obviously take up physical space, whether you're wearing and weilding them in a flesh sheath, or have them installed in a metal one. For these, you're limited to a certain number.

Other prototypes either come in the form of limited scope AI or programming modules that don't take up space, or they come in the form of implants that replace some part of you. For these, you can have any number you wish, as long as you remember the limits imposed by your level.

###### Equipped Prototype Maximums
|Type|Default&nbsp;Bonus|Max|
|---|:---|:---|
|Armor|Dodge|1|
|Energy Shield|PD|2|
|Implant|Recharge rolls|Any|
|Mod&nbsp;—&nbsp;Combat|MD|Any|
|Mod&nbsp;—&nbsp;Skill|Saves|Any|
|Weapon&nbsp;—&nbsp;Melee|Attack//Miss&nbsp;Damage|2|

|**Default Bonus:** Gain a +1 bonus to saves. This increases to +2 for Champion tier and to +3 for Epic tier.|</div>

##### Aggressive Cloudlink
**Recharge 16+**

Everything you've ever seen is backed up to the cloud, and everything that anyone else knows is out there too, but accessing it is time-consuming and possibly dangerous. When you use this method of recall, you fall unconcious and are helpless. You enter the networks and zoom along data lanes and through vast virual warehouses in a search for the information you seek.

You may swap out any one power for any other power of the same type that you have access to – once you figure out how to do it. At the start of your turn, make a skill check using a suitable background against DC 25. If you succeed, you wake up. If you fail, you’re still stuck in your thoughts and remain helpless for another round.

If you roll a 1, your body started to show symptoms of being Zoned while you're detained, and the virus is probably not happy to see your companions.

You can use Aggressive Cloudlink outside of combat, but it’s up to the GM how often you get to make skill checks to find your way back – life or death situations are great for focusing one’s mind on the task at hand. 

**Quirk:** Bibliophile.

##### Breath Training
You can stay water for a longer time than normal, up to twenty minutes. You know when you're about to run out of air, so you’ll have time to get to the surface.

## COMBAT basics

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Normally, characters do what they want, when they want to do it. However, in combat, it gets a bit more complicated. Everyone wants to do everything at once, so there needs to be a little more structure to keep things organized.**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Combat takes place in rounds, and each character involved in the combat gets one turn each round. On each character's turn, that character can use a Standard Action, a Move Action, a Quick Action. Once everyone has taken a turn, the round ends, and another one begins, as long as there are still creatures willing to fight.**</div>

### Combat Summary
Here is a summary of what each section of the chapter covers.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>
| | |
|---|---|
|**Combat Basics**|What numbers you need to use during combat, and how to start combat.|
|**On Your Turn**|How many actions you get per turn and what you can do with them.|
|**Out of Turn**|Options when it isn't your turn.|
|**Damage//Healing**|Damage rules, recoveries, and falling unconscious. Death rules, death saves, and optional death rules. Quick rests and full heal-ups.|
|**Conditions**|Both positive and negative status effects.|</div>

```
```

### Combat Stats
These are the basic numbers you'll need in combat. When you roll one of these numbers, you roll 1d20, and add the numbers shown below.
<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:20px'>

#### HIT POINTS
Hit points are based on class, Constitution, and level.
<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|---|
|Deadeye|(7 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Gatekeeper|(8 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Glitch|(6 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Nebula|(7 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Phage|(6 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Psiblade|(7 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Vector|(6 + CN) x level modifier.|
|Zerker|(8 + CN) x level modifier.|</div>

#### STACKING BONUSES
Bonuses and effects to a single stat stack with each other, with these exceptions:
<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|Only the best item bonus counts.|
|Only the worst penalty from each Condition counts.|
|Powers don’t stack with other powers with the same name.|</div>

#### COMBAT MODIFIERS
The universal combat modifier is +2 when you have advantageous circumstances. Similarly, –2
is the right penalty for adverse situations.

```
```

#### ALLIES
Powers are written with the understanding that a character’s allies are the other PCs in the party with a possible addition for an animal companion. NPCs don’t count as allies for abilities that are counting the number of allies that meet certain conditions.
 
#### Initiative
When combat starts, each character involved in the combat rolls either Reaction or Awareness.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|:---|
|Roll **Reaction** if your character is aware that combat is about to start.|
|Roll **Awareness** if your character doesn't know that there's about to be combat.|</div>

As Initiative checks are made, the Gamemaster marks each check as either PC or NPC. Then, he ranks the rolls in order from the highest number to the lowest. If a PC and an NPC check are tied, the PC wins the tie. The completed list is the Initiative rankings.

Creatures in combat take turns acting in the order of the Initiative results. Each creature may act once per round. The GM will announce whether the next result in order is for a PC or NPC. If the Initiative result is for a PC, the players decide which character that has not yet acted this round will take the turn. If the Initiative result is for an NPC, the Narrator chooses one NPC that has not acted this round to take the turn. Once all creatures in combat have acted, the round is over.

#### AMBUSHES
If only one side is aware of the other, an ambush may be set up. Initiative is rolled as normal, but any ambushers that move before surprised creatures gain an axtra standard action.

## ON YOUR TURN
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**When your turn in Initiative comes up, you can take one Standard Action, one Move Action, one Quick Action, and a few Free Actions in any order. At the end of your turn, you can attempt to save against status effects and recharge powers.**</div>

### STANDARD ACTION
Your Standard Action is the main thing you're doing this turn. It takes up the majority of your concentration or time. Making an attack, a skill check, or using a power is usually a Standard Action.

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Substituting Actions

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

You can always change a Move Action to a Quick Action, or change a Standard action to either a Move or Quick Action.

</div>

</div>

#### ATTACKS
When you attack, you declare which attack you are using and pick its target or targets, then roll the attack roll for each target to find out if you hit. The attack will indicate what happens to a target that you hit (and sometimes one that you miss). If you roll damage for your attack, roll only once for all your targets.

##### Targeting
Important stats for targeting should be transparent to PCs. The GM should tell you whether your targets are legal targets. For instance, if you have a power that targets creatures with a certain number of hit points or less, the GM should tell you their current HP and let you choose a different power or target if your first choice isn't valid.

A power that targets multiple nearby enemies in a group can’t skip over enemies. You pick one target and attack the rest in order; you don’t skip all over the battlefield. Powers that say they target multiple nearby enemies but don’t specify that they have to be in a group are capable of attacking in different directions, allowing you to choose targets from where they like.

When a power targets a nearby enemy, ally, or creature, you can’t target yourself unless it is explicitly stated that you can also be a target.

Compare your total to the target’s defense, usually Dodge but sometimes Fortitude or Willpower. If the total is equal to or higher than the defense, you hit. If you attack multiple targets, make multiple attack rolls. Each individual attack defines the effects of a hit or a miss.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting
You fight as normal, generally using the weapon in your main hand to attack. If your attack roll is a natural 2, you can reroll the attack but must use the reroll. You do not get an extra attack for fighting with two weapons.

Some classes (and class talents) provide other advantages when fighting with two weapons. Those classes still get to use this basic two-weapon advantage.

##### Flexible Attacks
Flexible attacks allow you choose your target first, make your attack roll, and then use the natural unmodified die result to determine which of your eligible flexible attacks to use. You still use the modified roll to determine whether or not you hit, but your flexible attacks trigger off the natural result on the die sitting in front of you.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:15px'>
| |
|---|
|You can only use one flexible attack at a time.|
|You can’t use a flexible attack when you make an opportunity attack.|
|If you have some attacks that are flexible and some that are not, declare whether you are making a flexible attack or a specific non-flexible attack before you roll.|</div>

##### Grabbing
You can grab enemies. Some monsters can too, so these rules apply to them as well. To grab a creature, make a melee basic attack. If you're successful, you can grab the creature instead of dealing damage.

When you grab a creature, you gain a +4 bonus to attacks vs. that creature. The grabbed creature, on the other hand, can't make ranged or opportunity attacks, though it can still make melee and close attacks.

The grabbed creature is also engaged with you and can't move away unless it teleports, somehow pops free, or successfully disengages. Grabbed creatures take a –5 penalty to disengage unless they hit the creature grabbing them the same turn that they try to disengage.

\page

<div class='footbgc'></div>

<div class='footchc'></div>

<div class='footchtxtc'>COMBAT</div>

<div class='footpgc'></div>

<div class='footpgtxtc'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

If you are smaller than the creature that you grab, you have to let go if you want to move. It can still move it can move — and carry you along with it! If you are the same size or larger than the creature you grab, it can't move, but you can, and you can drag it along instead.

You can let go of a creature it is grabbing as a free action, and you automatically succeed at the disengage check if you try to move away.

##### Ranged Attacks
Any ranged attack (weapon, power, ability, or whatever) draws opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with you that you don’t target with the attack. Close-quarters powers are the exception; they don’t draw opportunity attacks.

###### Shooting into Melee
When using a ranged attack to target an enemy that is engaged with one or more of your allies and you fumble (roll a 1), reroll that attack considering the engaged ally as the target. If there are multiple allies, the GM rules which ally is the target.

##### Unarmed Attacks
To punch or kick, make a Strength attack with a –2 penalty (regardless of your class) against AC. If you hit, you deal 1d6 damage for every two levels you have, plus your ST. At 1st level, use a d3. If you miss, you deal no damage.

##### Crits
Every attack roll that is natural 20 is a crit (“critical hit”) for double damage. Standard crits deal double damage and, at the GM’s discretion, might entail some additional superior result. If you manage to double your crit damage (through the effect of a talent, power, or other source), triple it instead. If you manage to double your triple damage, bump it up to quadruple, and so on.

###### Crit Range
Crit range is what you must roll to score a crit. The standard crit range is a natural 20. Some powers and spells expand your crit range. Each point of improvement drops the number needed to score a critical hit by 1.

```
```

###### Helpless Enemies
When you attack a helpless enemy you’re engaged with, you score an automatic critical hit if you follow these three steps:
- Skip your move action and your quick action that turn.
- Make a standard action attack on your turn against the helpless enemy you are engaged with.
- Your attack only targets the helpless enemy, even if the attack would normally target multiple creatures.

###### Fumbles
Rolling a natural 1 has no effect on the target, not even miss damage. At the GM’s discretion, rolling a 1 while in a precarious position might entail a bad result for the attacker. You might hit an ally if you’re shooting into melee.

#### RALLY
Once a battle, every PC can use a standard action to rally, spending one of their recoveries and regaining hit points they’ve lost in combat. (See Recoveries.)

If you want to rally again later in the same battle, make a normal save (11+). If you succeed, you can rally again that battle. If you fail the save, you can take your turn normally, but you can’t rally that round.

### MOVE ACTIONS
This is exactly what it sounds like: moving from one place on the battlefield to another. You can move from Far Away to Nearby, from Nearby to Engaged, or in the opposite direction as a Move Action. Sometimes a particularly difficult version of a Quick Action might take up a Move Action instead.

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Speed

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Characters can move around pretty freely. It’s not necessary to count the number of feet someone can move. If it’s important to know who covers ground faster, the GM is free to use the specific events in play to choose how to handle the contest. It can be as simple or as complex as he wants it to be.

<div class='footpgtxtc'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

#### LOCATION
Each creature has a general, relative position on the battlefield. Combat is dynamic and fluid, so miniatures can’t really represent where a character “really is.” To determine a character's location, ask two things:

<div style='margin-top:-15px;margin-bottom:20px'>
| |
|---|
|How far away from me is the creature or PC?|
|Is the creature or PC engaged with an enemy?|</div>

##### NEARBY
Generally, all the heroes and their enemies in a battle are nearby. That means they can reach
each other with a single move action.

##### FAR AWAY
Generally, the heroes and their enemies are nearby each other and you can use a single move action to reach any of them (provided no enemy intercepts you). If you want to be far away, two moves away from the enemies, make that clear to the GM and make sure there’s room for that maneuver.

##### ENGAGED
An engaged combatant has either made a melee attack against an enemy, or been attacked with a melee attack.

<div style='margin-top:-10px;margin-bottom:20px'>
|If you are engaged, you...|
|---|
|... draw opportunity attacks if you move.|
|... can attack enemies engaged with you.|
|... draw opportunity attacks from enemies engaged with if you make a ranged attack that doesn't include them.|
|... can disengage safely as a move action by making a normal save (11+).|
|... can’t intercept enemies.|
|... are nearby other combatants by default.|</div>

```
```

###### DISENGAGING
When you move away from Engaged enemies, those enemies each get to use Opportunity Attacks. You have two options: Either move and let them attack, or try to disengage. To disengage, roll a normal save (11+). If you're trying to disengage from more than one enemy, your roll takes a –1 penalty for each foe beyond the first.

If the disengage check succeeds, you can move without drawing opportunity attacks from the foes you were engaged with. Use your move normally. If you fail the disengage check, you don’t move, lose your move action for that turn, and remain engaged. You don’t take any opportunity attacks.

You also roll disengage checks for enemies attempting to move away from you. On an 11+, the creature can't move away without you making an opportunity attack.

##### FREE
A free combatant has not yet made a melee attack or been attacked in melee.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
|If you are free, you...|
|---|
|... move freely.|
|... can’t make melee attacks.|
|... make ranged attacks normally.|
|... can engage enemies by moving into melee with them.|
|... can engage an enemy moving past you.|
|... are nearby other combatants by default, but you can move far away if the environment allows it.|</div>

#### Special Movement Options
So far we've covered normal movement along the ground, but Flight and Teleportation could occur often.

##### Flight
The movement rules for flight are the same as for other movement, except that, as long as there is space available, you can fly over enemies you’re not engaged with without allowing them to take opportunity attacks against you. You can be intercepted only by other flyers that are already airborne.

The engagement and disengagement rules are also the same when flyers make melee attacks against enemies on the ground.

The player may choose to swoop past another flyer, as part of another attack, instead of engaging it directly, at a -2 attack penalty.

##### Teleportation
Teleportation is an effect by which a creature moves instantaneously from one location to another. Teleporting doesn’t draw opportunity attacks, but activating the power may; the rules don’t change because you are activating a teleport.

### QUICK ACTIONS
A Quick Action is anything that takes just a second or two to do, like reloading an energy clip, or typing in an access code. Some powers are Quick Actions, too.

```
```

### FREE ACTIONS
These actions take so little time that they're not worth mentioning. You can do a handful of Free actions each turn as long as they don't get out of hand. A bit of dialogue, tossing away an item, or switching modes on a weapon are all Free Actions.

### SAVES
After you've taken any of the moves above that you want to, make any saves that you need to make. If you are subjected to an ongoing effect that requires a save, make the save after taking damage from the effect.

The save mechanic, a d20 roll with no standard modifiers, handles everything from power recharge to saves against power effects to death saves.

There are three difficulty values for saves. If a save doesn’t specify what type it is, it’s a normal save.

##### Save Difficulty
|Difficulty|DC|
|---|---|
|Easy|6+|
|Normal|11+|
|Hard|16+|

There are no standard bonuses to saves, but there are occasional talents, feats, and items that provide small bonuses to saves.

## OUT OF TURN
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Most normal action happens on your turn. However, there's a few things you can decide to do when it's not your turn.**</div> 

### INTERRUPTS
You can use one interrupt action when it’s not your turn. You can’t use another one until the end of your next turn. These types of actions are usually limited to certain classes and class powers, however, there are two types of interrupt that every character can do.

#### INTERCEPT
Once per round you can intercept a creature attempting to rush past you to attack an ally. You must be near the enemy and the person that enemy is trying to reach. Make an at-will melee attack against the enemy. If you deal damage, the enemy must stop moving, and is now Engaged with you.

#### Opportunity Attack
An Opportunity Attack is a Basic melee attack that you can make once per round. You can make an opportunity attack against am Engaged enemy that...

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|... makes a ranged attack that does not include you as a target.|
|... moves away from you without a Disengage check.|</div>

### FREE ACTIONS
Creatures can also take free actions when it’s not their turn as part of a triggering condition.

### SPECIAL ACTIONS
When things look bad, and you're out of the fight, or it looks like you might be, here's two more options you have.

```
```

#### INSPIRE
This is a special combat action that you can take when you are out of the fight altogether. Once a round you can specify how your character is still there “fighting in spirit” alongside the other party members. Come up with some story about what your character has done that could boost party morale. The GM may grant any ally a +1 bonus to attacks, Armor Class, Physical Defense, or Mental Defense. The first time each battle that someone fights in spirit may be a +2 bonus.

The bonus lasts one to two rounds. If the fight is still on and you have something else to add
to the story, sell it to the GM.

If you’re still (even partly) in the fight, then you can’t fight in spirit.

#### FLEE
Fleeing is a party action. On any PC’s turn, any player can propose that all the characters flee the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen heroes away with them. The party suffers a campaign loss. The point of this rule is to encourage daring attacks and to make retreating interesting on the level of story rather than tactics.

## DAMAGE
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Every creature has hit points. When you deal damage to a character, you lower their hit points by an amount equal to the damage. When an enemy is reduced to 0 HP, they are killed or incapacitated. PCs at 0 HP begin using the Death and Dying rules.**</div>

### Damage Basics
Each attack indicates a specified amount of damage it does; subtract that amount from the target’s hit points. If the attack targets multiple enemies, you make a separate attack roll for each one, but only roll damage once.

Damage totals for your attacks are calculated by adding one ability score to the attack’s damage roll, normally represented by saying ‘+ XX' to indicate the Ability to use.**

#### DAMAGE TYPES
Different monsters and characters may be resistant or vulnerable to various types of damage, including:

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|**Acid** eats away at whatever it encounters, whether metal or flesh. Small amounts leave its victims in pain. Larger amounts don't leave victims at all.|
|**Cryonic** damage is essentially making something cold very quickly. It could be associated with ice or the hard vacuum of space.|
|**Entropic** energy causes decay. It attacks the bonds between atoms, and often smells like rotting.|
|**Gravitic** damage is like being shot by a small singularity. It's like having your arm twisted, except that it's your heart or lungs instead.|
|**Psionic** energy attacks a creature’s mind directly, causing nosebleeds and crippling migraines.|
|**Shock** damage causes both live targets and computer systems to short out and renders them mostly unable to act. Associated with short-term memory loss and the smell of ozone.|
|**Sonic** weapons use infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies to damage targets internally.|
|**Thermic** damage superheats the space or objects around a target, like laser and plasma weapons.|
|**Toxic** damage attacks a target internally, like poison or infection.|</div>

```
```

#### ONGOING DAMAGE
|PCs|Monsters|
|:---|:---|
|Take Ongoing damage at the end of your turn|Take Ongoing damage  at the beginning of their turn.|
|Damage ends with a successful save.|Damage continues with a successful save made by the PC that deals the damage.|
|When a battle is over, you succeed at any remaining saves.|Monsters that flee succeed at any saves once theire off the battlefield.

At 5th level, double the ability score modifier before adding to the damage roll for all attacks. (Negative modifiers get are doubled too). At 8th level, triple the ability score modifier.


#### Miss Damage
By default, a miss deals no damage, though some attacks are an exception. These attacks specify what happens on a miss.

#### WEAPONS
Weapons are rated by how much damage they deal. In the hands of player characters, each weapon attack deals 1 die of damage per character level + ability, notated as WEAPON + [Ability].

Each class has its own version of the weapon chart, showing how well members of the class use weapons of a given damage category.

<div style='margin-top:-0px'></div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: Flexible Weapons

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

In a memorable situation, when the action in the story backs it up, the GM might decide that a weapon’s normal dice should be swapped for bigger or smaller dice, letting the character roll the same damage dice of a larger or smaller weapon.

</div>

<div class='footpgtxtc'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

#### RESISTANCE
When you have Resistance to a certain type of damage, you take half damage from any attacks that deal that type of damage unless your defense roll is below your rating. The lower the number, the more resistance you have.

If you take ongoing damage of a type you resist, use the original attack roll to determine whether you take the full amount of ongoing damage or half the amount (rounded down).

Any creature with resistance to an energy type is immune to normal energy of that type. Attacks, weapons, powers are different: the damage they do can get past the resistance. This resistance = immunity rule only applies to energy types, not to weapons. Weapon resistance does not mean immunity to weapons.

Some enemies have Resistance as well. It works the same, but keys off your attack roll instead of your defense roll. Enemies with Resistance to a certain type of damage take half damage from any attacks that deal that type of damage unless your attack roll is above their rating.

#### STAGGERED
When you are reduced to half your hit points or fewer, you’re staggered. Some powers and monster interactions work differently when you are staggered. In general, monsters become staggered when they take damage equal to half their hit points or more.  

#### UNCONSCIOUS
When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious. You can’t take any actions until you’re conscious again, though you do make a death save at the start of each of your turns.

When enemies drop to 0 hp, it means they’ve been slain, unless the characters’ intent is to keep them alive and the attack seems like a potentially humane blow that could knock someone unconscious instead.

```
```

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: Lasting Wounds

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

If you’re dropped to 0 hp or below one or more times during a fight, you take a lasting wound. Each lasting-wound reduces your maximum hp by an amount equal to 2 + your level. Lasting-wounds are cumulative. Staggered is still half or less of your maximum hit points. A full heal-up removes all lasting-wounds.

</div>

</div>

### DEATH//DYING
When you drop to 0 hp or below, you fall unconscious and can’t take any actions (except to make death saves). To make a death save, roll a d20 at the start of your turn, and find your result below.

###### Death Save Results
|Roll|Result|
|:---:|---|
|20|Roll a Recovery. You now have HP equal to your roll and are concious. You can take actions normally this turn.|
|16&#xfeff;-&#xfeff;19|Roll a Recovery. You now have HP equal to your roll and are concious. You can't take any actions this turn.|
|1-15|You take one step toward the grave. After the fourth failed death save in a single battle, you die.|

###### Negative Hit Points
You also die when you reach negative hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. If you heal or get healed while you are dying, ignore any current negative hit points. Start from 0 and add the hit points you’ve regained.

## Healing
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Each PC starts the adventure with at least 8 recoveries, a stat that represents the PC’s ability to heal or bounce back from damage. Many healing powers and items require you to use up a recovery. So does rallying during a battle.**</div>

### Recoveries
When you use a recovery, regain lost hit points by rolling recovery dice equal to your level and adding your CN. Your class indicates which recovery die to use.

At 5th level, double the bonus you get from your CN. At 8th level, triple it.

If you perform an action that requires a recovery but have none left, you get half the healing you would otherwise get and take a –1 penalty to all defenses and attack rolls until your next full heal-up. This penalty stacks for each recovery used that you don’t possess.

### STABILIZING ALLIES
If one of your allies is unconscious and you don’t have any powers or items to heal them, you can still stabilize them to keep them from dying. Get next to them and make a DC 10 healing skill check using Wisdom as a move action.

##### Stabilization Check Results
|Roll|Result|
|:---:|---|
|**1-9**|You waste your move action, but you don’t hurt your friend.|
|**10&#xfeff;-&#xfeff;24**|You stabilize your ally. They now have 1 HP.|
|**25+**|You treat their wounds so quickly that it only takes a quick action; you can use your move action normally this turn.|

A stabilized character is still unconscious, rolling death saves on their turn, but failed death saves no longer take them a step closer to death. Ignore failed death saves while stabilized. Using a healing item on a dying character gets them conscious and back on their feet, but always takes a standard action.

```
```

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: Harder to Die

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Using this rule, PCs can only be fully slain by named villains. PCs who fail four death checks fall into a coma and can only be brought back to consciousness once they’re fully out of danger.

</div>

</div>

### REST//RECHARGE
After each battle, you can use a quick rest to get ready for the next battle. After four battles, you’ll usually earn a full heal-up.

#### QUICK RESTS
When you take a quick rest, you can choose to heal yourself by using as many recoveries as you have available. If you are staggered when you take a quick rest, you **must** try to heal yourself, either with a recovery or from a power that provides healing.

For each recharge power that you used in the last battle, roll a d20 to see if you keep the power for your next battle or lose it until after your next battle. You have to roll the power’s recharge value or higher to use it again.

#### FULL HEAL-UPS
After approximately four battles, characters earn a full heal-up, though the exact number is determined by the GM. Tougher battle can mean more frequent heal-ups, and vice versa.

After a full heal-up, your hit points reset to full. You regain any recoveries you’ve used. All expended powers are regained or recharged. (“Daily” powers are actually “per heal-up.”) If the party is short of a heal-up but is too beat up to press on, they can retreat and take a full heal-up, which entails a campaign loss. (See Flee.)

## STATUS EFFECTS
<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Status Effects change the actions you can take and the actions that can be taken against you. Status Effects listed below are general rules. Powers that contradict these rules override them.**</div>

### Effect Basics
Positive status efects usually say either, 'until the end of the turn', or 'until the end of the battle'. You can end positive status effects early. On your turn, spend a free action; there's no save required.

Most negative status effects have a duration, either 'until the end of the turn', 'save ends', or 'save continues'.

#### Save Ends
'Save ends' effects will originate from a threat and target PCs. An affected PC needs to succeed at a save to end the effect. The save is normal unless otherwise stated.

#### save continues
'Save continues' effects will originate from a PC and target PCs. The PC causing the status effect needs to succeed at a save to continue the effect. The save is normal unless otherwise stated.

###### Confused
Confused creatures can’t make opportunity attacks. Their next turn is spent attacking a random nearby ally with a random basic or at-will attack. A confused creature only moves if it's neccesary to reach their target.

###### Dazed
| |
|---|
|PCs take a –4 penalty to attacks.|
|Threats give their target a +4 bonus to defenses for that attack.|

###### Fear
Feared creatures are dazed and are unable to use the escalation die. They are also not able to move toward the source of the fear.

###### Hampered
| |
|---|
|PCs can only make basic attacks. They can still move normally.|
|Threats can only use their first listed attack. They can still move normally.|

```
```

###### Helpless
If you're unconscious or asleep, you’re helpless. Helpless creatures take a –4 penalty to all defenses and can be the target of a coup de grace.

###### Invisibility
Outside combat, Invisibility grants a +5 modifier to any stealth-related skill checks. In combat, attacks against invisible enemies have a 50% chance to miss completely, before the attack roll ever happens. If an attack misses an invisible creature, it deals no damage and has no effect on the creature. None of this applies if you’re dealing with creatures who can detect you without sight.

###### Phased
Phased characters cannot be the target of single-target attacks. Area attacks can hit where they are, but they aren't subject to non-damage effects. If two creatures are both Phased, they can attack and deal damage to each other normally.

###### Stuck
Stuck creatures can’t move, disengage, pop free, change their position, or let anyone else move them without teleporting.

###### Stunned
Stunned creatures suffer a –4 penalty to defenses and can’t take any actions.

###### Vulnerable
Attacks against Vulnerable creatures have their crit range expanded by two.

###### Weakened
Weakened creatures take a –4 penalty to defenses.

| |
|---|
|Weakened PCs take a -4 penalty to attack.|
|Weakened threats give their targets a +4 bonus to defenses for that attack.|

## REPUTATIONS

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Every character has reputations with the Networks. As a GM, you'll use a PCs’ Network Reputations three different ways: for planning sessions, for in-game dramatic events, and possibly for finding out what happens next.**

</div>

### SESSION PLANNING
All players roll their PC’s Network Reputation dice at the start of each session, and everybody sees the results. Look for fives and sixes.

#### Sixes
Rolling a six with an network die provides an unambiguous advantage. The player who rolls the six should note down which Network is associated with the roll. At some point in the session, usually at the beginning or end of a scene, the players can turn in sixes they've rolled for a benefit.

There's no specific mechanical benefit for the six. Indeed, it should usually be plot-based or provide new leads for the players rather than anything mechanical, but it could also be the temporary use of a new prototype weapon, or a last-minute warning of an impending ambush.

Rolling a six with a **Positive** reputation means that the network is sending official or unofficial help or is removing an obstacle for the PC.

Rolling a six with a **Conflicted** reputation might mean that the network still has use for the PC, so will at the very least want them more alive than dead, and may help on that basis.

Rolling a six with a **Negative** reputation could mean that the PC still has contacts in the network that could alert them to what the network is doing, and enemies of the Network may ally temporarily with the PC.

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

unused sixes

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

By the end of the session, every six should have come into play at some point. If there's any left over, they're given to the GM to use next session as fives.

</div>

</div>

#### Fives
Rolling a five provides the GM with an opportunity to spring a surprise on the players. It will almost always be unpleasant. Perhaps an unexpected enemy joins a battle, or an avenue of investigation is suddenly cut off by local authorities. When the GM announces the surprise he also grants a six to the player who rolled the five, which can be used as stated above.

The GM uses the results to think ahead about which icons come to the fore this session. Players use the results to start thinking about how their icon relationships might manifest in the story.

### DRAMATIC EVENTS
Players roll all of their relationship dice for a particular Network when their PCs are confronting that Network’s representatives, agents, or minions. The GM decides when an event-based roll is called for.

Story-guide rolls should occur most every session. Event-based rolls rise out of circumstances during play.

It’s never the player’s choice to roll Network Reputation dice for dramatic events. When new circumstances and dramatic events force or suggest interactions or confrontations with forces or situations associated with a particular Network, the GM can call for an Network Reputation roll as a shorthand guide to the dramatic results of the situation.

#### DRAMATIC FIVES
Getting a 5 on an Network Reputation check moves the story forward, just like a 6 does, but it also generates a complication. A 5 means both good and bad results. The negative result might be secret, it might be delayed, and it might be nothing more than a promise until you figure out what it really means.

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: DISCOVERY Rolls

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

GMs can Discovery Rolls when the characters have gone off the map, taking paths you hadn’t anticipated. For a Discovery Roll, players roll Network Reputations to find out which Networks are involved in a plot element, if any. There's no bonuis or penalty involved. When used this way, Network Reputation rolls can serve as an idea generator with mechanics that everyone already understands.

## ENVIRONMENTS

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Skill checks are graded by their environment, of which there are three tiers: adventurer, champion, and epic. The GM determines the environs where the adventure takes place.**<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Adventurer environments are for level 1-3 characters: city streets, wilderness areas, run-down orbital habitats, abandoned colonies, and that sort of thing.**<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Champion environments are for level 4-6 characters: long-ruined habitats, hostile off-Earth environments, xenophobic enclaves, and those sorts of places.**<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Epic environments are for level 7+ characters. They are typically related to Networks, ancient Orison nests, Zoned hives, Neptunian orbitals, and so on.**</div>

### Skill Checks
The environment the PCs are in determines the DC of skill checks and other challenges they may face.

###### SKILL CHECK DIFFICULTY
|Tier|Normal|Hard|Extreme|
|---|---|---|---|
|Adventurer|15|20|25|
|Champion|20|25|30|

|8|Half champion, half epic|
|9|Mostly epic, some champion|
|10|Always epic|</div>

```

### TRAPS//OBSTACLES
When you need to determine how much damage a trap or environmental obstacle deals, use the charts below, basing the damage on two things: the environment, and whether the damage affects one character or many.

Use the skill check DC on the table for PCs attempting to disarm a trap (once they notice that there is a trap). Failure means the trap will trigger.

## BUILDING BATTLES

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**For an encounter to be fairly balanced, the number of monsters should be equal to the number of player characters. Lower-level monsters count for less, and and higher-level monsters count for more.**

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Monsters start out being a challenge for PCs when they're even level at adventure tier (levels 1-4), but get harder at champion and epic tier. See the **Monster Equivalents** table on the next page for details on how to build an encounter.**

## After BATTLES

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**After a battle is over, characters can spend as many recoveries as they want to heal up and maybe find something worth taking. After four battles, it's usually time for a full heal-up.**</div>

### Full Heal-ups
A party should get a full heal-up after four regular battles. A full heal-up resets the characters' hit points to maximum, and gives them back the use of all their powers.

If battles are harder, consider giving the full heal-up to the party earlier. For storytelling, try to sync full heal-ups with an appropriate event in the game world.

If the PCs find some special source of healing when they don’t deserve a full heal-up yet, allow them to get one or two recoveries back and to make some extra recharge rolls.

If the party is able to rest and decides to heal-up ahead of time, they suffer a campaign loss. The story moves along, but the situation in the campaign gets noticeably worse for the party (at the GM’s discretion).

### LOOT//REWARDS
The truth is that the real currencies in Void Age are information and reputation. There's no real scarcity for the average citizen, so not everyone deals with currency. That means valuable items reach the PCs in one of two ways: as loot after a major encounter, or as a reward or prepayment for a job from a PC’s Network connections. Prototypes are also usually found in one of these two ways.

After each major encounter, usually once a day, roll for each character (or have them do it) on the **Rewards per Heal-Up** table below. All rewards should be from the character's current tier.

###### Rewards Per Heal-up
|Roll|Reward|
|:---:|:---|
|**1–2**|Nothing useful, trash items.|
|**3–4**|One non-weapon item.|
|**5–10**|One non-weapon item of PC’s choice.|
|**11–15**|Two non-weapon items of PC’s choice.|
|**16+**|Three non-weapon items of PC’s choice.|

```
```

### ZHANG
Reputation is currency in Void Age, and your identity is your bank. The cryptocurrency craze of the twentieth century was the foundation for Zhàng Securident to birth a new form of financial surety. Backed by both the Archive and the Boardroom, the Central Services Exchange is a virtual trading floor when services of all types are valued and traded among the megacorps.

When you buy something from someone, you digitally sign a gaurantee to render an equal amount of service in return, based on the current CSE rates. If your seller doesn't need those services, they'll probably list them on the Exchange. The Exchange tracks the worth of these gaurantees in Zhàng (Ẕ). One thousand Zhàng is 1kẔ, and one million is 1kkẔ. if you have a good reputation, your gaurantees will be worth more; if you're not reliable, though, your personal worth takes a hit. 

The party should run across approximately the amount of Zhàng shown on the **Credits per Encounter** table below. If you make a battle harder than normal, consider doubling the amounts shown.

###### Credits Per Encounter

### LEVELING UP
Characters advance a level after three or four full heal-ups. The whole party levels up together. Take the opportunity if you wish to explain how your characters came by whatever new abilities they gain from leveling up. Every time you gain a new level, you...

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|---|
|... gain a new feat.|
|... increase your hit point multiplier|
|... regain any lost HP.|
|... choose new talents or powers if your class gains any, or replace one if you wish.|
|... gain an extra Prototype slot.|
|... change sheathes if you want to, and you're near a location that has the necessary equipment.|
</div>

At **4th, 7th, and 10th levels** you add +1 to two different ability scores.

At **5th and 8th levels** you gain an extra Network Reputation point.

```
```

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Option: INCREMENTALS

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

After each session, the GM may award the players an incremental level. You choose one option below as if you'd just advanced to the next level. If you decide later that you don't like the choice you made, you can always change it when you level up. 

**Any Level:** Feat, Hit Points<sup>1</sup>, Power<sup>2</sup>, Prototype Slot, Skill Bonus<sup>3</sup>, Talent<sup>4</sup>

- If you're hurt, your current hit points increase by the same amount that your maximum Hit Points do.
- You can choose this until you've gained as many powers as you would next level. If you replace a power that has already been expended, the replacement power is also expended.
- This applies to skill checks only, not to attacks or defenses.
- You can choose this long as you'd gain a talent at your next level.

**3rd//6th//9th levels:** Ability Scores

**4th//7th levels:** Reputation Points

## THREAT RULES

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**Threats follow a different set of rules than PCs. For instance, Threat attacks deal a specific amount of damage instead of rolling for damage and genrally don’t add on the escalation die. Threats may also have abilities or powers that are triggered by certain attack rolls.**</div>

### SIZE
Each monster has a size that ranges from Normal to Large. Smaller threats are generally outlined as Mooks.

#### MOOKS
Mooks are weaker threats that can be cut down in large numbers in a single turn. Damage is not tracked against single mooks, but against the entire mob of mooks you’re facing. If you roll damage against a mook and it is greater than the single mook’s hit points, then another mook takes the remainder. In this way, damage can cascade to multiple mooks, and a player can kill multiple in one turn, even if they’re not all directly within your attack range.

<div style='margin-top:-15px'>
| |
|---|
|A mook’s hit point value is one-fifth that of a regular threat.|
|Mooks move and attack individually. Mooks deal a fixed damage when they hit, and double damage when they roll a natural 20.|
|Mooks can be split up into multiple groups with different initiative numbers and hit point pools for each. Subtract five from the mooks' initiative to creare another group. TO make more groups, subtract 5 again, and so on.|</div>

#### LARGE
Large threats generally have twice the hit points and deal roughly double the damage of a normal-sized threat. They also count as two threats when you build a battle.

#### HUGE
Huge threats have triple the hit points, deal triple damage, and count as three normal-sized threats when you’re putting together a battle.

<div></div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Extra-Strength Threats

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Regular-sized threats may also have the same stats as large and huge threats, in which case they are labeled as double-strength and triple-strength threats, respectively.

</div>

</div>

### ABILITIES
Threats may have special abilities for use in battle.

#### BURROWING
Burrowing is a special rule for threats that allows somewhat restricted movement underground. Unless otherwise specified, threats generally do not leave functional tunnels behind them when burrowing.

A burrowing creature on the surface may burrow underground by using a standard action.

After successfully burrowing, a creature may move underground, faster or slower depending on the hardness of the ground, out of sight of other creatures, hidden and safe from attacks.

For breaking through to the surface, the sequence is as follows: a move action from deeper under the ground to come close to the surface, close enough that people see there’s something coming, followed by a quick action to break through, and then by a standard action attack. Targets of the attack may make a save to avoid being targeted by the attack.

##### Burrowing Defense Saves
|Type of Ground|Save Needed|
|:---|:---|
|Sand, dirt, forest soil|Hard (16+)|
|Hard-packed dirt, loose rocks|Normal (11+)|
|Rock, caves, man-made floors|Easy (6+)|

<div class='footbgc'></div><div class='footchc'></div>

<div class='footchtxtc'>THREAT INDEX</div><div class='footpgc'></div>

<div class='footpgtxtc'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

#### DEATH ATTACKS
Some threats have a special attack called a death attack that can kill (petrify, paralyze, liquefy, immolate) in a single attack. Such attacks offer the player a last-gasp save.

A player that is affected by a death attack has a limited amount of last-gasp saves to try to throw off the condition of the death attack. 

An ally may assist a player affected by a death attack. The ally must use a standard action to help the player shake off the attack. This gives the player a free last-gasp save that may be rolled immediately. This free save is of normal difficulty (11+) instead of hard, and a failure does not count against a character's normal three saves.

\page

<div class='footbgc'></div><div class='footchc'></div>

<div class='footchtxtc'>THREAT INDEX</div><div class='footpgc'></div>

<div class='footpgtxtc'><div class='pageNumber auto'></div></div>

##### LAST-GASP SAVES
On the first turn a player is affected, the player may make a single action (standard, move, or quick), after which they must roll a hard save (16+). A successful save means that the player can act normally on the next round, unless the player rolls a natural 20 for their last-gasp save, which means that the player can take their turn normally in the current round. If the save is unsuccessful, their turn ends and the player may not take any other actions on future turns except for further last-gasp saves. Each successive last-gasp save is a hard save (16+).

Once a player fails four last-gasp saves while fighting off the death attack, the death attack effect succeeds, and the player is adversely affected as the attack indicates.

#### FEAR
Some threats are so fearsome that any characters that try to attack the threat in melee find it hard to focus. A character engaged with such a threat must have a certain amount of hit points (according to the level of the monster with Fear) or be dazed (-4 attack) and gain no benefit from the escalation die.

If the character’s HP increases past the fear threshold or if the character disengages from the threat, they lose the dazed effect and regain the escalation die benefits.

```
```

|14|192|
</div>

#### GROUP ABILITIES
A few threats have limited abilities that can be used a certain number of times in a battle for the group. Any threat within that group may use the ability, but then the number of available uses is decremented for the entire group. It does not matter which threat inside the group uses the ability.

#### Opportunity Attacks
When a threat makes an opportunity attack, it must use its first attack as a melee attack. If that attack action normally includes multiple attacks, it can make only one attack roll.

## THREAT LIST

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**All threat listings follow the same format. General information about the threat comes first, then combat stats, and then attacks and powers.**</div>

<div style='margin-top:5px'></div>

#### SAMPLE THREAT BLOCK
Information about the threat is listed here.

<div style='margin-top:-10px'>|SIZE/STRENGTH|LEVEL|ROLE|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|XX|XX|XX|</div>

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|XX|XX|XX|</div>

**Threat Abilities:** All threat attacks and abilities will be listed here, starting with the threat's default basic attack. Other attacks and special abilities the threat has are listed afterwards.

If an attack can target more than one creature or if it includes multiple attacks, that information follows the attack.

### SIZE//LEVEL
These are the key stats that determine how tough a battle will be using the creature.

Sizes are normal, large, and huge. Normal-sized threats can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x).

### ROLE
The threat's role gives you an idea of how the threat fights. For instance, blasters prefer to stay at range, while wreckers generally rush into melee.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>
| |
|---|:---|
|**Mooks** are minor threats that are good cannon fodder.|
|**Troops** are most common and are usually melee.|
|**Wreckers** and **Blockers** are also melee. Wreckers deal far more damage than Troops. Blockers keep PCs away from weaker ranged threats.
|**Blasters** and **Leaders** prefer to stay out of melee. The former deals damage; the latter helps allies and hinders PCs.|
|**Spoilers** mess the PCs up with attacks that inflict harmful effects instead of or in addition to hit point damage.|</div>

### TYPE
Some powers or items care about threat type. The six types of threats are Animal, Mech, Orison, Sapient, Weird, and Zoned.

<div style='margin-top:-15px;'>
| |
|---|:---|
|**Animal** life includes all non-sophontic life that has not been deliberately interfered with. It does include mutations  due to environmental contamination.|
|**Mechs** include everything from both old-fashioned dumb robots to the latest wave of hyper-intelligent AI sheathes.|
|**Orison** includes any life that originates on the other side of Orison wormholes.|
|**Sophonts** are sentient, self-aware creatures that share intelligence relatable to humans.|
|**Weird** creatures started off life as normal creatures, but something (e.g. experimentation, genemod splicing gone wrong, or Orison intervention) has made them something far more weird... and dangerous.|
|**Zoned** are people (and sometimes animals) that have had their higher cognitive functions burned out by a virus that links them all together into a hive mind bent on feeding.|</div>

### Threat Abilities
This lists all attacks and other abilities that the threat has. If an attack can target more than one creature or if it includes multiple attacks, that information follows the attack value.

#### Actual Komodo Dragon
The name pretty much says it all. A small group of fantasy enthusiasts funded research into making the Komodo Dragon into an actual dragon, and started fooling around with its genetic structure. Long story short, it can now spit its vemon, and to top it off, the venom is flammable. They do make very loyal housepets though, if you can forgive the occassional scorched wall.

**Envenomed Bite:** 19 vs. Fortitude; 7 toxic damage
- **Natural odd hit or miss:** The actual komodo dragon can use fire breath as a free action.

**Fire Breath:** Close 19 vs. Dodge (1d3 nearby enemies in a group); 10 thermic damage.

**Resist fire 6:** When a thermic attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.

**Resist toxic 6:** When a toxic attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 16+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.

**Fiery Aura:** Each creature engaged with an actual komodo dragon at the start of its turn takes 1d6+1 thermic damage.

**Flight:** The actual komodo dragon can fly, but needs to land to attack.

```
```

#### ANIKTOCANTHUS
When early attempts to recreate an ankylosaurid resulted in soft-shelled beasts with only a few spikes, a bit of armadillo lizard DNA was spliced in to counteract the defect. The problem was solved, but the new seven-meter-long species developed a troublesome habit of grabbing it's tail and attempting to roll over the zookeepers whenever it didn't get its way.

**Distracting Tail Snap:** 22 vs. Fortitude; 84 damage.
- **Natural odd hit:** The aniktocanthus hits the target with its tail and the target pops free from the aniktocanthus.
- **Natural even hit:** The target is Grabbed in the aniktocanthus' mouth.
- **Natural odd miss:** The aniktocanthus deals an extra 25 damage on it's next attack.

**Rolling Ouroboros:** 20 vs. Fortitude; 60 damage.
- **Multiple Targets:** The aniktocanthus always targets as many enemies as it can in a relatively staight line.
- **Limited Use:** When the escalation die is even.

**Immunity:** The aniktocanthus is immune to Daze, Stun, and Weaken effects, though not any damage that might come along with them.

**Tough:** The aniktocanthus ignores the first 15 damage it would take each round.

#### BEARMOEBA
Early in the diaspora, when water was a desperately needed resource, one lab began experimenting with quantum duplication to try to produce more water. While the process used became one of the building blocks of modern matter replication, the original trials had a much different and unexpected result. The experiments were meant to be done on pure H<sub>2</sub>O, but it was discovered far too late that the water used had contained tardigrades. Now the size of actual bears, the bearmoebas overrun the lab within hours and disappeared into the wild.

**Split:** As a quick action, the Bearmoeba can split into two monsters with half of its hit points plus five.

**Consume:** As a quick action, the Bearmoeba can consume a nearby Bearmoeba and heal the amount of its remaining hit points plus five.

**Grinding Mouth:** At the start of its turn, the Bearmoeba feasts on enemies it has grabbed. It deals 5 damage and heals the same amount.

```
```

#### Biceratops
Imagine a rhino with a frill that's as big as a bus. That's a Biceratops. A few incomplete chains of ceratopsid DNA were easily connected by splices of rhino DNA. The resulting animal sports a  small crest that protects it's neck, but it's also inherited the rhino's temper. Understandably, not a lot of research has been carried out on the adults.

**Chaotic Charge:** 22 vs AC; 70 damage, and the target is knocked prone and Stuck until they use a Move action to stand up. A Nearby ally can also spend a move action to help them up. The Uniceratops may make a Trample attack against the next closest enemy. Continue making Trample attacks until one misses, or the Uniceratops runs out of targets. Each enemy may be targeted only once.
- **Natural Defense Roll of 5 or less:** The Uniceratops may immediately make a save against Dazed, Stunned, Helpless, Confused, or Weaken.

**Trample:** 18 vs PD; 42 damage.

**Enraging the Beast:** When an enemy scores a critical hit against the Uniceratops, it makes a Trample attack against every Engaged enemy.

**Personal Space:** When an enemy engages the Uniceratops, it must make a save. If the save fails, the Uniceratops may make a Trample attack as an interrupt against that enemy.

#### BOG SCUM
First spotted in the aftermath of the nuke strike on what was once Cape Canaveral, the bog scum quickly multiplied and spread through nearby wetlands consuming the large quantities of dispersed chemicals. It does not display any intelligence to speak of, but it does display hunger. The bogscum needs pollutants to survive, so it's natural habitat is not usually contested. As a result, the bog scum is now a familiar sight throughout the world in contaminated zones.

**Engulf and Dissolve:** Targets engulfed/grabbed by the bog scum take 20 acid damage at the start of the bog scum’s turn but are not viable targets for additional attacks by the bog scum. Multiple targets can be held within the bog scum simultaneously.

Any engulfed creature that is also staggered must begin making last gasp saves or become paralyzed as the bog scum’s toxins overwhelm it.

**Sheeeeeerlp:** Close 22 vs. PD - 42 acid damage and the target is stuck until the end of the bog scum’s next turn.
- **Natural Defense Roll of 1:** Target is stuck until the end of the battle.

Bears are dangerous their own. They don't really need to be given zeroed steel claws, high-tension laser-trigger muscular enhancements and armor plating. It does make the illegal fights more fun, but occassionally one of these gets lose, and then all bets are off.

#### Gate lurker
One of the first (and most important) discoveries made when using wormhole technology was that something exists between one side of the gate and the other. Though transit is instantaneous, there's another dimension involved, one that is home to some very dangerous creatures. The first sign of this was a massive, writhing tentacle that whipped out of the first Mars-to-Jupiter jump gate and snapped back into hiding carrying the project's lead technician. 

Despite the name though, gate lurkers don't just wait at jump gates. They can be found anywhere there is higher than usual gravimetric disturbance. Presumably there is more to the creatures than the tentacles that come flying out of wormholes, but you won't ever see it unless you're unlucky enough to be pulled back through.

**Ripping tentacles:** 18 vs. AC; 10 damage.
 - **Natural even hit:** If the target is taking ongoing gravitic damage, the attack deals +2d6 damage.

**Writhing grasp (Group Ability):** Ranged +8 vs. PD (1d3 enemies in a group); target is grabbed and takes 5 ongoing gravitic damage, save ends.
 - **Group Ability:** For every two gate lurkers in the battle (round up), one of them can use writhing grasp once during the battle.
 - **Natural Defense roll of 6-4:** While the target is taking the ongoing psychic damage, it is dazed (–4 attacks).
 - **Natural Defense roll of 3 or lower:** While the target is taking the ongoing psychic damage, it is confused instead of dazed.

**Can Reach Fliers:** Gate Lurkers can target fliers just as easily as those ground-bound characters.

#### giant graeffei
The natural form of this horse-sized pink slug lived in Australia, and was probably one of the few things on the continent that wasn't meant to kill you as soon as you saw it. The giant version, though, sees a lot more things as food.

Giant graffei live anywhere with enough moisture to sustain them, and they'll eat just about anything that fits in their mouth.

**One Thousand Formerly Microscopic Teeth:** 18 vs. AC (2 attacks); 15 damage

**Regeneration 10:** While a giant graeffei is damaged, its rubbery flesh heals 10 hit points at the start of the its turn. It can regenerate five times per battle. If it heals to its maximum hit points, then that use of regeneration doesn’t count against the five-use limit.

When the giant graeffei is hit by an attack that deals thermic or acid damage, it loses one use of its regeneration, and it can’t regenerate during its next turn.

If the giant graeffei would drop to 0 hp while it has any uses of regeneration left, it spends a regeneration and takes no damage.

**Experimental Victim:** Graeffei have been experimented on, suffered from nuclear fallout, and much else. Roll 1d6 to find out how they were changed.
- **(1-2) Increased Regeneration:** Increase the giant graeffei’s regeneration dice; the baseline amount a giant graeffei regenerates should run about 1/9 of its total hp, but you can go higher to be nasty.
- **(3-4) Mutated Defenses:** Thermic and acid don’t hurt the giant graeffei’s regeneration; cryonic and entropic does instead.
- **(5-6) Rending:** If both microscopic teeth attacks hit the same target, the target also takes 10 ongoing damage.

#### HIVES
Insects were among the most affected by the fallout from the last great war. Some were hardier than others, and those that survived soon began growing, and with their larger size came new signs of intelligence. They soon learned who was responsible for the mess on their planet.

The hive could be one of several different types of creatures: Ants, wasps, termites, etc. Add an ability that fits with that type of hive. For instance, ants and termites gain the Burrowing ability. Wasps and bees gain Flight.

##### Hive Worker
Hive workers are both the general workforce for a hive and its militia. They won't usually seek out combat, but they will defend the hive with thier life.

**Throw:** 15 vs PD; 4 damage and the target is moved to a nearby location. If that location would put the target in any further danger, treat it as a hazard. Throw may be used once per three Hive Workers.

**Small Profile:** Hive Workers take half damage from opportunity attacks.

##### Hive Drone
Hive drones are larger than workers, and they're only concerned with protecting the Queen. If they see you as a threat, you're already much too far into their territory.

**Royal Presence:** Any nearby allies gain a +2 bonus to attack when another ally is engaged with the same target.

#### Humans

##### ASSASSINS
As long as people have felt that there is a need for someone else to just stop existing, there have been assassins, and even though mankind has spread throughout the solar system, that need still exists. So too then, do assassins. You may never learn who they work for, and with their shadowy backgrounds, unless you're an client or target, you may never see them at all.

###### Hitsquad
Hitsquads work in teams, attempting to surround their targets to create a crossfire or to overwhelm them with sheer numbers.

#### Ichiroraptor
Unlike some of the other retroclones, the ichiroraptor was made mostly on purpose. Late in the twenty-first century, when first-world militaries started taking flack over sending tates Army was looking for a more vicious guard animal. Its researchers combined velociraptor, cassowary, and gecko DNA, with a fairly predictable result — a vaguely dog-sized ball of screaming rage. It's mostly got the velociraptor's looks, but does sport a thick bone crest, or casque, on it's head. It prefers to lie in wait for prey on ceilings, or in trees. It's extremely territorial, and does remember intruders.

**Disemboweling Slash:** 20 vs. AC; 9 damage.
- **Natural Even Roll:** The Ichiroraptor can make an Enervating Scream attack against one enemy its not engaged with as a free action.
- **Miss:** Reroll the attack and take the second roll.

**Enervating Scream:** 18 vs. MD; 6 sonic damage, target is Vulnerable, save ends.

**Sticky-toed:** The ichiroraptor may move at normal speeds along flat walls and ceilings withint needing climbing checks.

When the escalation die advances to 3, the ichiroraptor summons an additional group of 1d4+1 ichiroraptors without this ability. Only one ichiroraptor may use this ability in each battle.

#### Mechs
Whether run by algorithms, sentient AI, or resheathed people, mechs are sent where it's either unsafe or inconvenient for biological beings to go. They're used on the front lines of battles, to explore far-away Kuiper Belt objects, and to dive into inhospitable environments.

##### Infantry Mechs
These mechs were designed to take the place of humans on the battlefield. They're small enough to go where their obsolete counterparts would go, but well-armed enough to take on larger threats.

###### Executive
The Executive, or XO for short, is ubiquitous in many places, used for routine maintainence and repair, and remote troubleshooting. In many labs, hundreds of Assistants are in service at any given time doing the repetitive, tedious tasks that keep it in business. They're so often seen they're nearly invisible, making them a popular choice for spies.

**Slam:** 16 vs. Fortitude; 5 damage

**Patchwork Repair:** Once per battle, one nearby construct ally can recover 5 hit points.

**Darkvision:** The Executive can see in darkness as if it were daylight.

**Telecontrol:** The Executive telepathically communicates with its controller even if the controller is far away. While they are connected, the Executive’s controller can hear and see everything within the Executive’s hearing and line of sight. It’s important to note that “owner” and “controller” may not be the same person....

```
```

###### Scarab
Scarab-model mechs often serve as messengers and scouts, carrying encrypted orders and communications in areas where they might be otherwise intercepted. They stay linked with their controllers telepathically, so they can even serve as stand-ins at meetings. Lacking the room to carry much weaponry, their main threat is the incapacitating toxin they carry.

**Bite:** +6 vs. Fortitude; 5 toxic damage and the target starts making saves.
- **First failed save:** Target is stuck (save ends).
- **Second failed save:** Target takes 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends both the ongoing damage and the stuck condition).
- **Third failed save:** Target becomes helpless (save ends the ongoing damage, and the stuck and helpless conditions).

**Telecontrol:** The Scarab telepathically communicates with its controller even if the controller is far away. If the Scarab can no longer communicate with its master it follows the last command it received for about an hour and then becomes dormant.

**Darkvision:** The Scarab can see in darkness as if it were daylight.

###### Sentinel
Sentinels are designed to keep the peace. Those who can afford them often
employ these heavily armored humanoid mechs as sentries and soldiers. Sentinels tirelessly patrol city streets or keep watch on important locations. When engaging an enemy, they always offer the chance to surrender first, and will stop fighting if an enemy yields.

**Automated Alert System:** Once per battle if a Sentinel is staggered, it can call 2d4 additional Sentinels as a quick action. PCs who know about this ability can jam the signal with a DC 15 skill check. Sentinels who are called in this way do not have this ability.

###### Baskerville
A guard dog needs to eat, sleep and crap. Those are weaknesses. The Baskerville has none of those, and has better speed and a stronger jaw to boot. Baskervilles are often left to roam enclosed porperties on their own, but they do sometimes appear with Sentinels or even human controllers.

```
```

###### Spider Turrets
Spider turrets are named obviously, since they resemble mechanical spiders. Spider Turrets can move back and forth in pre-designated areas to get the best line of sight possible, but they do not move to engage or retreat, expect in that small area.

**Climber:** Spider Turrets can climb like their namesake.

###### Hunter
Heavily armored handlers of the Baskerville, Hunters are distrusted by most people and hated almost as much as the hounds.

###### Phalanx
Phalanxes are upgraded Sentinels, with several extra layers of armor, especially around their vital areas. They do not normally patrol, but only appear when called to particularly dangerous situations. Though they will defend themselves, they will not initiate combat unless ordered to. When they do fight, they are unrelenting, attacking one target as a group until that foe surrenders, flees, or is defeated. They usually attack the closest enemy unless instructed otherwise.

**Darkvision:** The Hunter can see in darkness as if it were daylight.

###### Valkyrie
The Valkyrie is an AI-driven android that generally sees work in riot control situations deemed too hazardous for human law enforcement. While not the most curious or creative AI, the Valkyrie is still capable of figuring out ways to make a protester's day very, very bad.

**Plasma Bolter (Ranged):** 18 vs. Dodge; 10 damage

**Resilience:** Any saves made to continue conditions on the Valkyrie are one step harder. (Easy becomes normal; normal becomes hard.)

###### Upgrafted Sniper
Some soldiers who die in battle wake up to discover that they couldn't afford to be resheathed. Instead, they're sheathed into proprietary frames that can only be unlocked by their creditors, and made to work until they pay off a replacement for the frame they lost. This procedure is known as upgrafting, and isn't always legal, but that doesn't matter for the upgrafted, since it's really their only choice.

###### Upgrafted Assassin
Even though some would say the upgrafted are horribly treated, everyone has to admit that those who use upgrafting make sure their employees are given the tools they need, even on their upgrafted frames. The Assassin for instance is given active camouflage that makes the Assassin name accurate all too often.

- **Natural 16+:** The target is Feared until the end of its next turn.

**Active Camouflage:** The Upgrafted Assassin may make a move action to become invisible (DC 20 to spot) until it attacks. If the assassin starts its turn invisible it gains a +2 attack bonus on its first attack that turn.

**Resilience:** Any saves made to continue conditions on the Valkyrie are one step harder. (Easy becomes normal; normal becomes hard.)

###### Upgrafted Commander
When high-ranking mercenaries die, they're usually upgrafted to more sophisticated frames. Commanders work in tandeom with other frames to repair and guide them during battle.

**Mechsquad Leader:** The Upgrafted Commander can spend a move action to choose one of the following three effects:
- **Initiative:** An ally gains a +2 bonus to initiative.
- **Attack:** An ally rerolls it's next missed attack.
- **Shields:** The Upgrafted Commander grants itself or an ally 5 temporary HP. 

**Resilience:** Any saves made to continue conditions on the Upgrafted Commander are one step harder. (Easy becomes normal; normal becomes hard.)

##### Orison Mechs
Those who claim to be in the know when it comes to the Orison also claim that the orison didn't use mechs until they came to humanity's home. Orison mechs, or litanies as some have started calling them, are more grown than built, and they don't always seem to follow the same rules as the rest of the universe. That shouldn't be surprising for something created by the Orison, though.

###### Thornstar
This ball of shredded, spiked metal with flexible, razor-sharp tentacles is lethal to just touch. Now imagine it rolling over you.

###### Calabi
It's hard to tell just what shape a Calabi is, since it never appears the same way twice. It's limbs loop through it's ribcage but if you blink they're spiny projections from it's back. Get too close, too often, and you might just find yourself somewhere you didn't mean to be.

**Otherwhere:** A creature that is reduced to a negative initiative count in a battle involving one or more Calabi moves forward in time, reappearing somewhere outside the immediate battlefield. They reappear anywhere from several minutes after a battle is over to about an hour after the battle ends.

###### Fractal
Fractals are humanoid, at least in general. But they continually turn themselves inside out, resulting in a man that appears to change his face every split-second. Fractals leech energy from anything around them, though how exactly this happens isn't quite clear.

- **Save result of 5 or less:** The Fractal can use Roiling Fingers as an immediate free action.

**Mental Fatigue:** The escalation die does not increase the round after a Fractal drops to 0 hp.

###### Escher
Eschers twist between two dimensions and three, seeming to treat space as if it were optional. Their elongated heads and spindly bodies keeping them out of reach while they still reach you. They flee away up walls to hit you between the shoulder blades, or charge you to suddenly attack from the ceiling.

Piloting Mechs

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

An unattended mech is sometimes tempting for PCs. If they want to go for it, let them! The way a PC uses a mech is simple.

It requires a standard action to climb into a mech and begin piloting.

The PC uses his own actions to move and attack with the mech. In other words, to move the mech, he spends a move action; to attack he spends a standard action.

While in a mech, the character uses the mech's Dodge and Fortitude, but his own Willpower. He may also use the mech's powers, but can use none of his own powers with the exception of those that grant the pilot or his allies passive bonuses or rerolls.

The pilot gains the Ejection Sequence power listed in the box labelled Mech Pilots.

</div>

</div>

<div class='notebg'>

<div class='notettl'>

Mech Pilots

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

Since the typical user is unextrordinary, exosuits are classified as mechs, but in the event that someone who's more of a threat without the suit were to use one, count the pilot at half its normal points when building the encounter, replace the exosuit's Willpower with the pilot's, and and give the exosuit the following power:

**Ejection Sequence:** When an attack drops this exosuit to 0 HP, the attacker makes a save, as follows:
- **Adventurer Tier:** Easy
- **Champion Tier:** Normal
- **Epic Tier:** Hard

On a success, the pilot is incapacitated. On a failure, add the piot of the exosuit to the battle.

</div>

</div>

```
```

##### Exosuits
Exosuits were originally engineered by asteroid minering companies who needed an extra layer of protection in the belts. They've since been adopted by other groups who want extra muscle too.

###### Iris
This is about as basic as a suit gets. An extremely reinforced frame surrounds the user a foot or so on all sides, so that in the event of a collision with an asteroid, the frame gets hurt, not the user.

**Immunities:** The Iris cannot be Dazed, Weakened, or made Vulnerable to anything other than it's inherent Vulnerability. The Iris is also immune to Ongoing damage.

**Vulnerability:** Thermic
 
###### Juno
The Juno exosuit is still very barebones, but includes an additional layer or armor around the roll cage.

###### Vesta
Once the Europa breaks the asteroids into smaller pieces, the Vesta is the one that grabs anything worth grabbing and hauls it out to a waiting freighter with it's 360-degree grav net.

###### Ceres
The Ceres has two functions: Manhandle the asteroids the Europa can't cruch, and shield the freighters from unexpected damage from the asteroids breaking up. The Ceres is on the upper edge of what can be called an exosuit. It's as big as some asteroids it's responsible for.

#### Frontline Mechs
Just as Infantry mechs were designed to take the place of human fighters, these larger smartmechs were designed to take the place of frontline equipment: tanks, artillery, etc. 

###### Ardent
The Ardent line of mechs houses the bare minimum of AI, just enough to walk, target, and shoot. They prioritize by size, and then by armor. As long as threats are flagged they keep up their attack. They have a bit of a problem with collateral damage though, so they're most often used away from civilian areas.

Ages ago, stone golems were idols brought to life by worship. Some of these godlike golems still wait patiently in hidden places. In more recent ages, the worship rituals have been refined into spells of binding, and they work just as well or better.

Special Virtues
Each marble golem is infused with two (or more) virtues—magical properties that relate to the emotion or feeling incorporated into the sculpture as its dominant theme. Choose two virtues from the list below, or for a unique marble golem, invent your own. Awe (fear effect): While nearby the golem, enemies with 40 hp or fewer are dazed (–4 attack) and do not add the escalation die to their attacks.
Beauty: The first time each enemy attacks the marble golem this battle, it must roll a normal save; on a failure, the attack takes a –6 penalty.
Courage: While staggered, the marble golem adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.
Endurance: When the marble golem rolls a natural 1–5 with an attack roll, it heals 1d10 hit points per point on the escalation die. (It was checking for damage and got distracted.)
Hatred: When an enemy is staggered by the marble golem’s attack, that enemy takes 4d10 extra damage.
Patience: Each turn, the marble golem can use one standard action to gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of its next turn. If it does, it gains an extra standard action during its next turn.
Protection: When the marble golem rolls a natural 16+ with an attack, decrease the escalation die by 1.
Strength: The marble golem’s melee attacks now deal half damage on a miss.

Records from earlier ages indicate that iron golems were the finest bodyguards in the world. Something went wrong. “Comrade iron golem” is now how you refer to someone dangerous but supposedly on your side who can be trusted to betray you soon.

Large 10th level wrecker [construct]
Initiative: +13
Fists of iron +17 vs. AC (2 attacks)—50 damage
Miss: 5d10 damage.
Golem immunity: Non-organic golems are immune to effects. They can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, or touched by ongoing damage. You can damage a golem, but that’s about it.
Rampage: At the start of each of the iron golem’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is equal to or less than the escalation die, the iron golem goes on a rampage that turn. Instead of its two normal fists of iron attacks, it can make three attacks with fists of iron, each against a different random nearby creature, enemy or ally. It can move after each such attack as a free action, if necessary, taking only half damage from opportunity attacks during the rampage.
Poison gas: The first time the iron golem is staggered, poison gas leaks from it into the area. It can make a poison gas cloud attack as a free action.
[Special trigger] C: Poison gas cloud +15 vs. PD (all nearby creatures)—25 ongoing poison damage

###### Steam Golem
With wicked axe-blades inset along its arms, bronze runes inlaid on its armored torso, and a cast-iron belly glowing red with fiery heat, this heavy construct looks to be a deadly machine.

##### Piloted Mechs
Although remote fighting is popular in almost every sector, sometimes the distances involved, or the weight of decisions that need to be made mid-combat require real people to be present. These mechs are generally piloted by the very best, the most deadly pilots available.

Hill Giant
Hill giants carry their personal goods in massive sacks. The
contents of such sacks—shiny rocks, interesting bones, broken
keepsakes—bear a disturbing resemblance to the contents of a
child’s pockets.

Stone Giant
Stone giants love tying human-sized captives to great wooden
pins and bowling at them, hooting like thunder as the great pins
tumble. So when you find a strange long flat area in the Giantwalk
Mountains? It’s not your lucky day for a flat camping site. Get out
of the lane.

Fire Giant
Fire giants are some of the
most powerful mortal beings
to walk the land, and they
know it. They are not merely
warlords and conquerors but also
planners and builders. For about a
century, they have been building great
works high in the mountains. Their seers
say that a war that will destroy all is on its
way. With no hope of survival, fire giants are
not much concerned about whose side they will
fight on, so when the morning of battle comes, they
will fight on the side of those who have bribed them
the best.

Storm giants don’t bother hating those

They just don’t think enough of them

#### Megacroc
A lot of major effects have very small beginnings. In the megacrocs' case, it wasn't their fault that they started growing so huge.

#### Neowolf
Neowolves are the result of several breeds of dogs, bred for size and intelligence, escaping into the wild. Mixing with themselves and natural wolves, they have become more than the sum of their parts. In many wilderness areas, neowolves are showing signs of creating their own cultures, and some even appear to have their own strict breeding protocols.

When the wolves howl, each enemy in the battle takes a penalty to its attacks and all defenses equal to the number of living dire wolves in the battle (max –5) until the end of the attacking wolf’s next turn. New howls extend the duration of the current howl rather than downgrading the howl’s effect if dire wolves have been slain in the meantime.

It was true at least; they did survive the nukes.

##### gladiator scorpion
The gladiator scorpion is a loner, but none the less deadly for that. These scorpions grow to be the size of a car, and get their name from the fact that they often use cars as armor.

#### Possible Mistake
Let's be honest. The world didn't need another apex predator, so resurrecting the saber-tooth tiger was not a great idea. Deciding to use reptile dna to fill in the gaps because it was 'an elegant solution' was even worse. Making more than one of them was also ill-advised. These mistakes were almost instantly regretted by everyone involved. No one involved will ever own up to those mistakes though, beacuse they're all **dead**.

The mistakes ended up with several snake-like, scaly tails where the tiger's tail should be, each about ten feet long. They also inherited the tiger's stalking ability and the patience of both. Having an empty lab suited the hybrid quite well, as it happens. It took up residence in the labs that made it, and as the population spreads, the young also look for similar disused laboratories or other box-shaped abodes when trying to find a nest.

- **Natural 3 or less:** The possible mistake can grab the target and make an oversized fang attack against it as a free action.

**Oversized Fangs:** 22 vs. Fortitude (one enemy it’s grabbing; includes +4 grab bonus); 16 damage.

**Tail Flail:** Once per round, a possible mistake can make a tail coils attack as a free action against a moving nearby creature it is not engaged with; on a natural even hit, the target is grabbed and its movement stops.

**Home Turf Defense:** The possible mistake gains a +2 bonus to all defenses while fighting in its nest or in environs similar to abandoned research labs.

#### PSYCHOTHERAPIST
The name is a somewhat morbid play on words for what the psychotherapist looks like - a wrinkled, purple or violet body that's rather reminiscent of a brain that's sprouted slimy, three-meter-long tentacles to match. It also does a pretty good job of figuring out what you're feeling since it can scare you to death by touching you.

- **Natural 4-7:** Target is weakened, save ends.
- **Natural 3 or less:** Target is confused, hard save ends.
- **Miss:** The Psychotherapist gains +4 bonus to Dodge and Fortitude until its next turn.

**Fear Threshold:** 18

**Tentacle Terrors:** Any character struck more than once by a psychotherapist's tentacle suffers from lucid night terrors. At the end of combat, a Hard save ends this effect; otherwise, the condition can be reversed with appropriate treatment (probably the flexible use of a power or by making it a plot point). Characters suffering from night terrors are Feared, but can spend a recovery to regain the use of the escalation die until the end of the encounter. Spending the recovery does not end the fear effect.

**Slime in the Water:** If a target is engaged with the psychotherapist and rolls a natural 1 or 2, they inhale psychotherapist slime, and become able to breathe water, but not air until the next long rest. They must immediately begin making death saves. An ally may succeed at a DC 20 heal check to end the effect.

#### Werewolf
In the dawn of gene-splicing technology, one of the more popular uses was to modify your children, either for hardiness, or intelligence, or even just good looks. It usually worked out okay, but sometimes...

Werewolves are almost always completely feral; very few even learn to talk. They roam the wilderness in packs with other werewolves or with natural wolves. They posses greater than normal strength, heightened senses, and the inability to use straws or say the letter 'm'.

**Resist Weapons 12+:** When a weapon attack targets this creature, the attacker must roll a natural 12+ on the attack roll or it only deals half damage.

## New Monsters

<p style='font-size:13.5px'>**There will almost certainly come a time when you need a threat that either doesn't fit the circumstances or hasn't been covered in the Index at all. When that happens, you can either modify an existing threat, or create a new one.**</div>

### Modifying Threats
Sometimes the threat you want to use isn't the right level. If you want to adjust a threat's level, first, compare its Initiative. Hit Points, Defenses, Attacks, and Damage to the default for a threat of its level. Mark down the differences (mark the  percentage of difference for the damage). We've used the Psychotherapist as an example (its Level 4 and Large).

| |Monster|Default|Difference|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Initiative**|17|—|—|
|**Hit&nbsp;Points**|108|108|0|
|**Defenses**|18/16/18|20/18/14|-2/-2/+4|
|**Attacks**|19/20|19|+0/+1|
|**Damage**|14/15|28|50%|
  
Take the differences you've gotten and modify the default listing for the level you'd like the monster to be. Then, adjust it's inititive up or down equal to the level change. We've adjusted the Psychotherapist to level 1 and level 10 as an example.

|Level 1|Default|Difference|Adjusted|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Initiative**|—|-3 levels|**14**|
|**Hit&nbsp;Points**|54|0|**54**|
|**Defenses**|17/15/11|-2/-2/+4|**15/13/15**|
|**Attacks**|16|+0/+1|**16/17**|
|**Damage**|10|50%|**5**|

|Level 10|Default|Difference|Adjusted|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Initiative**|—|+6 levels|**23**|
|**Hit&nbsp;Points**|432|0|**432**|
|**Defenses**|26/24/20|-2/-2/+4|**24/22/24**|
|**Attacks**|25|+0/+1|**25/26**|
|**Damage**|116|50%|**58**|

### Monster Creation
But what if you have an idea for a threat and nothing in the Index seems to fit it? Follow the steps below and you can bring life to your idea.

#### Basics
Decide on the size//strength and level of the monster. Write down the base stats of the threat from the **Baseline Stats** tables.

#### Role
Choose the role that your monster will play on the battlefield and create it's primary and secondary attacks.

#### Tactics
Choose the preferred tactics of the threat. Adjust stats and attacks accordingly.

#### Powers
Choose one power for Adventurer-tier threats, two for Champion-tier threats, or three for Epic-tier.

#### Tweaks
Make small adjustments to make your threat just right.

### Basics
First, decide how powerful your monster needs to be, and what the first and last levels that your players will encounter it. If it's a small range, say, levels 3 to 5, you can make a single monster in the middle of that range (level 4) and use the modification rules to adjust it's level when needed. For a longer range of levels, you may want to make one version for each tier that your players will meet the monster.

As with monsters in the book, you need to choose a size for monster. Sizes are normal, large, and huge. Normal-sized monsters can have double-strength (2x) and triple-strength (3x).

Once you've decided on these things, note down the baseline stats from the tables below, and then move to the next step.

#### Initiative
Establish a threat’s initiative bonus by adding its level to a modifier between 9 and 19.

###### Agility and Initiative
|Initiative Score|Speed|
|:---:|:---:|

|14|Quick|
|15|Fast|
|16|Really fast|
|17|Fast like a fast PC|
|18|Blindingly fast|
|19|Competing with the Glitch|

#### Attack Bonus
You can adjust the default attack bonus by +1 or -1 to show that a threat is more or less accurate than normal.

#### Strike Damage
Orient yourself around the average damage for a threat’s attack at any given level. When it comes to large or huge (or double- or triple-strength) threats, you can split damage up into multiple smaller attacks or use conditional follow-up attacks instead of making just one large attack.

##### Multiple Targets
If an attack would deal damage to more than one target, consider adjusting the damage down a bit, unless there's some reason why you shouldn't. The **Multiple Target Damage** table gives suggestions for this. Choose the number of targets for the attack, and multiply the attack's base damage by the multiplier.

###### Multiple Target Damage
<div style='column-count:2'>

|Targets|Multiplier|
|:---:|:---:|

#### HP//AC
Use the defense numbers as the top-end rather than the baseline unless you want the difficulty to scale up.

#### Better//Lesser Defenses
Make either PD or MD better than the other, in general.

#### Fear Threshold
If the monster has a fear ability, it’s the number of hit points where creatures are dazed (–4 attack) while engaged with the monster and can’t use the escalation die. It’s based on level, so that higher-level monsters are more fearsome.

Power Synergy
</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

There are some of these powers that most likely should not be used together. Which powers these are will change with the choices you make about the monster. If it seems overpowering to you when you're creating the monster, it probably is.

### Tweaks
After the first three steps are done, you've got a workable monster. If you need to tweak it though, keep in mind the following guidelines.

#### Stat Adjustments
Stat adjustments work fine when limited to adjustments of one or two points. If you raise a couple scores, drop a couple others.

#### Triggers
Some monster abilities use a natural roll as a trigger. If it makes sense for your monster to change the trigger, that's fine. It's a good idea, though, to keep the activation percentage the same. For instance, changing a natural even trigger to a natural odd trigger results in the same amount of die rolls (50%) triggering the effect.

Things to Avoid

</div>

<div class='notetxt'>

First, avoid making it harder for a monster to be killed unless there’s an offense to unlock the defense. If you give a monster a very high AC, consider lowering it's PD or MD by the same amount.

Second, make sure the monster will be challenging, not boring. For instance, you can give a monster immunity to weapons, but just because one character can bypass the immunity doesn't mean the rest of the group will have fun. Likewise, If you increase the AC or the HP and compensate by lowering damage, the combat will be longer and full of misses; that might not be fun either.

Earth isn't dead; it's just not relevent.

The corporations keep their workers happy, but the underbelly of society is lined with the oppressed.

The Orison are a growing threat, but not a new one. They've been around since pre-history.

What it means to be human is changing.

To date, members of five terran groups are listed as Sophont besides humans: apes, dogs, elephants, corvids, and octopodes. An attempt was made to uplift dolphins, but it was met with insults and abandoned

There were five quasi-sapient animal genera that survived until uplifting was possible. Of those, only two were ever sheathed, the octopodes, and the apes.

Elephants, for some unknown reason, suffer extreme physical pain when inserted into any type of sheathe, either biological or mechanical. 

The corvids, when uplifted, all immediately voted to be uploaded into dataforms, and vanished.

The dolphins refused any genetic modification whatsoever, repeatedly calling researchers 'slowship chasers' and 'inbred fish' until they were left alone.
